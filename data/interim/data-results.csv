Though their mandates are different, overlaps are occasionally encountered leading to duplication of effort. As an example, some aspects of meat inspection fall under the meat control act, which is administered by the department of veterinary services; other aspects are under the public health act administered by both the ministry of public health & sanitation and the ministry of fisheries development. Veterinary medicines lie under the ministry of livestock development but are regulated by the ministry of public health & sanitation. To strengthen these services, the livestock subsector in collaboration with the private sector and stakeholders will reform the legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks; build capacity for delivery of animal health and quality assurance services; and domesticate and implement sanitary measures according to regional and international standards. Access to markets is a precondition for livestock development. The economic growth of livestock producers will depend on fair market access to their livestock products.

In a 2008 report titled the deadly dozen; the world conservation society CS observes that the spread of these diseases since the mid-1990has resulted in an estimated us$ 100 billion in economic losses globally. Much of horticultural practice in kenya is carried out in asals, making the sector highly susceptible to the impacts of climate variability and change. The recent adverse weather has seen a decline in fresh vegetable production in laikipia, kieni, kibwezi, machismo and tomtit andei. This has subsequently affected export earnings from this sub-sector. The sector is likely to be further affected by increasing pressure from european markets and consumers seeking to reduce their fresh produce carbon footprints, i.e. The amount of GHG emissions associated with the production and consumption of fresh produce.",0.161393213741535
