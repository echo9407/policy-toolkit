Additional analysis is needed of the costs and benefits for specific restoration interventions in combination with business models and enterprises in order to more accurately inform the allocation of resources to support the implementation of restoration. Applied research needs to be supported to improve the understanding of the drivers of land degradation and the key success factors for the widespread adoption of effective restoration practices.",0.331520590151671

Both the initial and second national communications to the  and the napa developed by malawi outline strategies that can contribute to GHG mitigation while addressing other critical development objectives. These plans can serve as a basis for defining and recognizing nationally appropriate actions in a new climate policy. However, government faces national and local challenges in meeting international commitments, while ensuring that climate action remains compatible with its development agenda. Thus, we have witnessed a slow implementation process of the napa.
