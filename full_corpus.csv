"5214","1 5. climate is an active factor in the physical environment of all living things. climate change and variability are impacting forest ecosystem processes and functioning. response time of forest ecosystems to disturbances ranges from a very short duration to decades and even centuries, depending on the condition of the system and the type, intensity and duration of the external stimuli. the actual state of forest ecosystem largely depends on processes and practices of the past. therefore, forests are extremely complex to understand their functioning. climate change further magnifies those complexities and adds more uncertainties. forests are linked to climate change in three ways;they are source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions; ii they offer mitigation opportunities to stabilize ghg concentrations; iii they are impacted by climate change. impacts of climate change on forest ecosystem are getting manifested as species range shifts, changing biodiversity, physiological changes in plant life cycles, forest growth pattern of species, changing boundaries of ecosystems and other biotic and abiotic responses stresses. there are evidences of increase in the frequency and severity of forest fires, changing water regimes and expanding forest insect infestation. since forest ecosystems operate on large temporal scales, long observational studies are necessary to identify the key changes. accordingly grid based sampling is designed to provide relevant information to cover the characteristic time scales. 1 6. forests and wood products can effectively reduce the process of climate change in several ways. growing trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store the carbon so efficiently that about half the dry weight of a tree is carbon. this carbon remains locked up in the form of wood and wood products. sustainably grown and harvested wood and other biomass also provides a renewable alternative to fossil fuels and enhance carbon storage. enhanced carbon sequestration through recognised and innovative silvicultural practices, restoration of degraded mined out forestlands, improved biomass productivity, etc. will help in improving forest health and vitality. forest soil must be kept healthy and fertile. the growth of forest crops must be kept vigorous to attain the most desirable level of biomass production within an optimal time scale.

"14911","there is also a misconception that data collected by two or three methods can be statistically rationalized and converted into one estimate for arriving at an elephant population. ","data/results/Gajah ETF_REPORT_FINAL/37.txt","39","37","en"
"17104","the total count is a method where it is assumed that the entire area or estimation unit has been searched for elephants and that every single individual within the area has been individually seen and counted without errors, duplicates, or omissions. however, even if the entire area is surveyed, it is very unlikely that all elephants are detected and seen within the survey area. as the area becomes larger, denser in vegetation, more difficult in terrain, and poorer in light conditions, the observers ability to detect elephants may vary substantially within and across landscapes. cumulatively, this variation in the ability to detect them might create substantial bias when all data are pooled together for total estimation. besides sampling and observer-related variations, the unknown error related to detection is a major drawback for any statistical analysis even with several repeat counts.

"2882","the total count and the block sample count are not very different on the technical design. however, here instead of entire zone, small sample zones are surveyed with an assumption that if 1 5% area is sampled it may be expected to contain 1 5% of the elephants occurring in the entire zone. on the contrary, elephant distributions are far from uniform in the sampled zones and the process of selection of sample blocks becomes a critical issue if bias is to be avoided. additionally, the longer the time taken to do the estimation, the greater are the chances of double counting. elimination of double counts by selecting a few individuals for registration and identification does not work well and leaves lots of scope for biases. also, the issues of detection and variation identified in the total count method remain in the block sample count method as well.

"5194","the former method of generating a dung encounter based index of abundance is good enough to know changes in elephant population and habitat use. for many purposes, it is not required that one should know the actual number of elephants to correlate them with habitat and other anthropogenic or ecological factors. an estimate of number of dung piles, the relative distribution of dung piles and changes in dung pile encounter rate index over several seasonal comparison periods can provide a lot of information for detecting changes and taking necessary management decision to manage the area. as this method is easy, rapid and can be executed by moderately trained staff, it may be suitably applied across large landscapes for monitoring purposes.

"261110","in contrast, translating the dung data into elephant numbers has several pitfalls in assumptions and variability in estimation of dung density, dung decay rates or disappearance rate, and the defecation rate of wild elephants. the steady state assumption, i.e. that the number of dung piles produced by the elephants per day is equal to number that disappears per day is an untested hypothesis and can vary on seasonal context. the other variables can be estimated and corrected with several controlled experimentations on large dung samples in different in situ habitats and substantial hours of systematic direct observation on defecation behaviour of wild elephants. the project elephant dung enumeration guidelines 200 5 lay emphasis on conducting such experiments for almost 10 5 days on at least 12 0 dung piles on several stratified strata for the estimation of decay rates. however, this practically never happens in the field and also cannot be done without involvement of qualified biologists or trained personnel working under supervision of the former and an understanding of various statistical models and assumptions on the pattern of decay.

"6167","this case study explores the role of the forest department and other agencies in setting up and supporting autonomous joint forest management institutions and devising management plans that attempt to balance local subsistence biomass needs with off-site watershed ecosystem services. the case-study highlights how the participatory forest management pf rules of malachi pradesh were used to create space for a pea agreement at the divisional level in palampur forest division. it discusses the steps taken to facilitate the payment for ecosystem services agreement, and its subsequent implementation, and the relevance of such steps in a broader context of downstream and upstream stakeholders are coming together in the face of declining water supplies including from forest areas. forests for water requires balancing local subsistence demands with the hydrological services as well as other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. local adaptive experiments that attempt this balancing act are few. examples include the following shim la catchment municipal forest hp. perhapsthe best known early example of managing forests for water - about 100 0 ha of forest area was first leased and then acquired in the 1890 s-1900 s, and essentially locked up as it was the source of about 2 0 odd springs and streams that were tapped for himalayas original water supply. the uh river shaman hydro project in rang districthp was accompanied by the purchase of grazing rights of sheep and goat in its catchment, with the objective of reducing grazing and therefore erosion levels in the catchment of the hydro-project. the reserve forest, above ramshackle town, districtrang hp was the source of springs for water supply and local for fuelwood collection and grazing etc were acquired in an unusual move, apparently for spring protection. amoral town considered supplying subsidizedfuelwood to its residents, to reduce the pressure on upstream forests identified as spring catchments in the the rang forests cooperative societies were setup in the 1940in rang district to incentivize local communities to benefit from and manage forests locally and also reduce soil erosion for the region as a whole. the hill resource management societies hemsstarted from the sukhomajari experiment in haryana also attempted to moderate grazing pressures to reduce erosion and compensate locals by giving them a stake in the tree and barabbas grass sales and also broad-basing water rights from tanks. sacred groves in forest communities are often linkedto springs, thus suggesting they are a local adaptive technique for micro-zoning. the state of sikkim has started a large scale springmonitoring and spring catchment protection and management program in rural areas. about 50 0 springs are monitored in the program and interventions in the spring catchments have led to increases in lean season discharges of 10 0% to 30 0%. details are available at www.sikkimsprings.org the recently launched green india missiongim also has a cross-cutting mission focusing on maintaining and enhancing the hydrological role of forests especially in drinking water catchments. the delhi and southern arrival hills have beenidentified to be a recharge zone for the region by the central groundwater board.","data/results/JFM Forest Management Guidelines 1990/104.txt","39","104","en"

"21619","1.1 what is jfm joint forest management  jfm is an approach and program initiated in the context of the national forest policy of 198 8 wherein state forest departments support local forest dwelling and forest fringe communities to protect and manage forests and share the costs and benefits from the forests with them. communities organize themselves into a jfm committee to protect and manage nearby forests, guided by locally prepared byelaws and micro plans. the key element in jfm is that communities have the power to manage the use of forests by members and also exclude non-members. the benefits to them is direct access and control on the use and sale of most ntfps and a share in the income from timber as well as other intangible benefits from local ecosystem services  like water recharge, pollination, wildlife habitat etc. thus involvement of communities in conservation of forests and wildlife is of paramount interest.

"5428","the rationale and logic behind jfm is that the earlier approach of government control of forests by states put the onus of protection and management on forest department staff and excluded dis-interested local communities from the same. at the same time, forests were also diverted for other uses. increasing population further led to a situation of accelerated degradation and loss of forests through the 1970and 1980and the first state of forest report published in 198 7 highlighted the impact on forest cover. a key issue perhaps was that working plan prescriptions assumed protection after felling, which was almost impossible to enforce, leading to poor regeneration. the earliest experiments with jfm in west bengal succeeded as they engaged with local communities and promised them both short term alternative income and a long term share in timber.","data/results/JFM Forest Management Guidelines 1990/13.txt","39","13","en"
