"9102","the strategy realizes that malawis population is youthful with approximately half 4 6 percent below the age of 1 5, and up to 7 3 percent below the age of 3 0 years. this youthful bulge affects the economy in various ways. firstly, at the micro level of individuals and families, high rates of population growth are associated with high dependency ratios and low investment in the human capital of children and young adults. secondly, at the macro level, high rates of population growth hinder investment in both human and physical capital formation, and exert pressure on the environment and often result in unsustainable use of natural resources. the consequences of these pressures are that the capacity for service provision and land use planning is stretched, physical resources and infrastructure are always in short supply and therefore easily degraded. while acknowledging the foregoing, the strategy notes that the youth bulge should also be seen as a demographic dividend that needs to be harnessed in order to maximise on the benefits that can be derived from the youthful population. this implies that with meaningful integrated investment, the youthful population can be turned into an asset that can be used to develop the country.

"777","first year financial costs & financial gap the financial costs in the activity budgets are analyzed to estimate the first-year financial cost for each activity in the first year. the first-year financial costs can be thought of as the minimum capital investment that is necessary to successfully manage the restoration activity. it represents investments in equipment such as saws, shovels, seedlings, and other necessary implements. in many cases smallholders may already have the tools and inputs that are required. for example, according to the malawi agricultural and livestock census of 200 67, 9 9% of households own a hoe, 5 5% own a sprayer, 5 4% own a pangs knife and only 3% own a sprayer. as a result, the financial cost estimates reported here reflect upper bounds. it is also an important metric for understanding how much additional financial capital smallholders may need access to in order to adopt the restoration activities. if a woman or a man smallholder cannot make the proper investments in inputs and equipment it will be difficult or impossible for them to capture the potential benefits of restoration activities and other, low-input, restoration activities may be more appropriate.

","../data/raw/malawi/results/Vision 2020/15.txt",NA,"15","en"
"2935","the need for long-term planning has been underscored by various technocrats and scholars from very early times. it is generally agreed that a miscellaneous group of projects, each unrelated and uncoordinated to a master plan for the development of the economy as a whole, would take a country nowhere and may lead to chaos. inspire of this understanding, the concept of long-term strategic thinking has so far been missing from most development management efforts of countries such as malawi. development plans in africa typically covered four to five year periods while structural adjustment programs saps have even shorter time horizons. ","../data/raw/malawi/results/Vision 2020/15.txt",NA,"15","en"
"2635","an important element of long-term strategic thinking is for malawi to avoid relying solely on her ""natural"" comparative advantage. the country has to examine various factors strategically and then determine what and where her national competitive advantage will be. ","../data/raw/malawi/results/Vision 2020/16.txt",NA,"16","en"
"589","long term strategic thinking should incorporate a shared vision of where the country needs to go and how to get there. in corporate strategic management, the importance of a shared vision is recognized in motivating the members of the organization to achieve corporate goals. at the national level, a worthwhile achievable vision of the country's development priorities is one that is widely shared and becomes a force that motivates everyone towards greater achievements for the benefit of the country. the competitiveness of a nation is based on its ability to mobilize domestic resources in accordance with a shared vision of the future and an appropriate and sustained strategy for achieving it. ","../data/raw/malawi/results/Vision 2020/16.txt",NA,"16","en"
"1357","thus, the processes of formulating shared visions to guide a country's development efforts requires, among other things, visionary leadership. this is leadership that is constantly forwardlooking, creative and strategic in its thinking as well as actions. it also means that a way should be found to review the ever-increasing number of development issues and agree on those that represent genuine national aspirations and therefore, the countrys development priorities. ","../data/raw/malawi/results/Vision 2020/16.txt",NA,"16","en"
"19120","experience has shown that lack of popular debate over national development policies and implementation impose severe constraints on motivation for high productivity. citizens should be encouraged to participate not only in forging a shared vision for the country but also in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the development process. the psalter process helps to create awareness of developmental issues and needs within government and the general public. it is intended to enlist the people's active input as well as sustained support and interest in the resultant vision. the success of the vision depends on the public's awareness of their responsibilities to achieve the vision.

"3168","it is important to have this kind of approach because resources will always be insufficient to meet all the people's wish lists. thus, the people participate in the decision-making process and setting of priorities and should express their thoughts regarding the allocation of public resources. in this way, the technocrats will be certain that the plans they have finally made reflect the legitimate aspirations of the people. this increases the chances of success in the implementation of the final plans.

"1459","scenarios are hypothetical stories of the future which are constructed for the purposes of focusing attention on causal processes and decision points. since it is often argued that unexpected changes in the external environment were partly responsible for non-implementation of development plans in africa, it is necessary to anticipate such problems by planning for alternative scenarios on the out-turn of the external factors. scenarios ensure that plans avoid sub-optimal development paths by exposing negative events that might happen in the future and preparing in advance how to take care of these.
