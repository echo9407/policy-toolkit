344,"the rise in temperature could extend the ecosystems range of pests and pathogens. this is likely to affect many aspects of forests such as tree growth, survival, yield and quality of wood and non wood products. the impact of pests may result in the curtailment of plantation programmes, abandonment of a given tree species, or the necessity to harvest large areas dominated by infested trees as witnessed in the late 1990when the country had to clear huge tracts of cypress plantations because of cypress aphid attack. there are already fears of a widespread attack on pins spatula mexican weeping pine plantations in south africa and these could easily spread northwards to kenya.",1.0
