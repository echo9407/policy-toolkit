"23210"," kenya has not had a single and clearly defined national land policy since independence. this, together with the existence of many land laws, some of which are incompatible, has resulted in a complex land management and administration system. the land question has manifested itself in many ways such as fragmentation, breakdown in land administration, disparities in land ownership and poverty. this has resulted in environmental, social, economic and political problems including deterioration in land quality, squatting and landlessness, disinheritance of some groups and individuals, urban squalor, under-utilization and abandonment of agricultural land, tenure insecurity and conflict. to address these problems, the government embarked on the formulation of a national land policy through a widely consultative process with the aim of producing a policy whose vision is to guide the country towards efficient, sustainable and equitable use of land for prosperity and posterity. stakeholders from public, private and civil society contributed towards the policy formulation through thematic groups based discussions, regional workshops and written submissions. past initiatives such as the presidential commission of inquiry into the land law system of kenya, the constitution of kenya review commission and the presidential commission of inquiry into the illegal irregular allocation of public land also informed the formulation process. this sessional paper has thus been formulated to provide an overall framework and define the key measures required to address the critical issues of land administration, access to land, land use planning, restitution of historical injustices, environmental degradation, conflicts, unplanned proliferation of informal urban settlements, outdated legal framework, institutional framework and information management. it also addresses constitutional issues, such as compulsory acquisition and development control as well as tenure. it recognizes the need for security of tenure for all kenyans all socio-economic groups, women, pastoral communities, informal settlement residents and other marginalized groups. the sessional paper designates all land in kenya as public, community or private. most significantly, it recognizes and protects customary rights to land. it also recognizes and protects private land rights and provides for derivative rights from all categories of land rights holding. through the sessional paper, the government will ensure that all land is put into productive use on a sustainable basis by facilitating the implementation of key principles on land use, productivity targets and guidelines as well as conservation. it will encourage a multi-sectoral approach to land use, provide social, economic and other incentives and put in place an enabling environment for investment, agriculture, livestock development and the exploitation of natural resources.
