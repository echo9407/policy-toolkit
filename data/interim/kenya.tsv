0	the purpose of the middle level institutions is to provide a link between national and local level implementation of asds, technical support and coordination between ministries and stakeholders. in this connection, the following institutions will be strengthened  the inter ministerial coordination committee icc will be expanded to include all ministries that provide services to the agricultural sector. the icc will be composed of permanent secretaries of the collaborating ministries, and will be responsible for coordinating the planning of the strategy at the agricultural sector level and monitoring its implementation to ensure that its goals are achieved.	n
1	to address these challenges, the government will implement the regional development policy, rationalize and restructure the authorities, and consolidate the regional development acts. emphasis will be on developing resource master plans and implementing integrated development programmes that create social and economic impact in the regions and nationally. more specifically, the following interventions will be implemented  implementing policy and institutional reforms to strengthen regional development planning  developing and conserving river banks, water bodies and catchments areas  developing community support and empowerment programmes  formulating and implementing integrated basin based development programmes.	n
2	lack of a database and information to support regional development is another major constraint. this has contributed to lack of comprehensive planning by stakeholders in the regions. therefore, supporting information and records management in the subsector will provide the necessary data to support development planning and provide investment opportunities.	i
3	to contribute to efforts to reduce poverty and increase income, the subsector will promote integrated community programmes that support empowerment ventures and reduce poverty in rural areas. to achieve this, partnerships, collaboration and linkages with other stakeholders will be forged in the use of devolved funds in rural areas.	i
4	secretariat. its terms of reference will include preparing technical guidelines for implementing the strategy and formulating interventions according to tefl budgetary process and the medium term plan.ascu has established thematic working groups that address key fast track areas of the strategy in consultation with relevant sector players and resource persons.	n
5	the government shall also further reform and streamline agricultural institutions that provide services to farmers such as extension, training, research and regulatory services to ensure that they serve farmers efficiently and cost effectively. we shall also institute policy, legal and regulatory reforms so that individual farmers are encouraged to shift from subsistence to market oriented production, and to adopt greater use of modern farming practices while increasing integration of agriculture with other sectors in the national economy.	n
6	the government has taken bold measures to combat corruption, promote good governance and instil a sense of financial discipline and prudent management of the economy. as a result, kenyas relations with development partners have improved dramatically in recent years. this has resulted in a major increase in external assistance, which has had a positive impact on the inflow of foreign investment and the delivery of services by the government.	n
7	energy is one of the infrastructural enablers for agricultural growth. the level and intensity of commercial energy use in the agricultural sector is a key indicator of the degree of economic growth and development. to improve the energy supply, the agricultural sector ministries, in collaboration with the rural electrification authority, will develop a comprehensive rural electrification master plan to enhance agro industry.	n
8	the youth will be sensitized on lucrative ventures in the agricultural sector, and processing plants for value addition will be established in rural areas to provide employment opportunities for the youth and to allow them to produce agricultural raw materials. linkages between the ministry of youth and sports and the agricultural sector will be established to offer incentives to the youth in farming either through the youth enterprise development fund, constituency development fund or the innovation fund for agriculture and agribusiness.	i
9	much of the current planning is as a result of years of centralized planning, which has been supported by the systems for accessing external support, mainly through the government ministries. the top down system is supported by human resources and other institutional arrangements.	n
10	an innovative feature of the strategy is its implementation through local authorities and district development committees where district development plans are formulated; district agricultural development plans will be a component of district development plans. agricultural development at the district level will be incorporated into the overall development plans of the district. an important and new role for the lead agricultural sector ministries will be to ensure that local authorities appreciate the importance of a strong and vibrant agricultural sector within their districts, and give it priority in planning and in allocation of funds. local authorities will allocate a proportion of locally generated funds for agricultural development and thus qualify for grants to supplement their efforts to develop the agricultural sector. other sources of funds like the cf will be channelled to activities that give priority to agricultural development.	i
11	implementing outcome agricultural sector strategic agencies growth result areas 1. crop land development subsector sector ministries, private sector organizations institutions, development partners, ministry of planning and national development, ag chambers, ministry of finance, and parliament.	n
12	the strategic thrust of increasing the productivity, commercialization and competitiveness of agricultural commodities will enable the sector to export more outputs, earn the country foreign exchange, and create employment. with the responsibilities of the agricultural sector currently spread across 1 0 ministries and the need for partnerships with several other ministries and stakeholders, implementation of asds will require strong partnerships among the government, private sector, development partners and other non state actors. a sector wide approach and strong coordination mechanisms will be instrumental in the success of the strategy.	n
13	currently, the responsibilities for agricultural development are spread across the sector ministries. other ministries responsible for roads, local authorities, administration, health, education, trade and industry, and finance support the functions of the agricultural sector ministries. key stakeholders will implement the agriculture sector development strategy asds in a sector wide approach in which sector ministries, the private sector and development partners will each have distinct roles to play coordinated by the the asds will be implemented through the established structure of government ministries that go to the district, division and location level. each sector ministry will work out the activities under its dockets and make elaborate financing plans in the medium term plans, which will be funded by the government of kenya, development partners and the private sector. implementation will be carried out through the medium term expenditure framework tefl of financial allocation by treasury. the expenditure frameworks and the medium term plans will be harmonized with the respective development documents currently being implemented by the planning and finance ministries to align them with vision 203 0 and other government development plans.	i
14	the government also established and supported many agricultural institutions such as farmer cooperatives and those for agricultural inputs, marketing, credit and agroprocessing. budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector during this period was at an average of 1 3 per cent of the national budget.	i
15	reviving agricultural institutions. one of the pledges of the narc government was to revive all public institutions that provide services to citizens. within the agricultural sector, this has been a success story. institutions that were on the verge of collapse and have since been revived are the kenya meat commission, the kenya cooperative creameries kcc, the kenya seed company, the agricultural finance corporation, and the agricultural development corporation. institutions that were considered moribund and dysfunctional, such as research and extension services with their subcentres, training centres and tractor hire are now vibrant and providing services to farmers. even institutions that were running into losses, such as the sugar factories, have been revived, are reporting profits and are on the verge of being privatized.	n
16	the ascu mandate is to facilitate and add value to the reform process and to coordinate the efforts of sector ministries and other stakeholders towards implementing the asds vision.	n
17	ascu will link the sector players and provide an enabling environment for sector wide consultations along the various levels of implementation, from the division to district to national level. ascu will not be involved in the actual implementation of the strategy. however, it shall coordinate budgeting within the sector, and participate in the review of subsector strategic and annual work plans to ensure they conform to asds, vision 203 0, the megs and other government development agenda.drive reforms in the sector and fast track implementation of the asds in a coordinated manner across sector ministries and other partners  be the referral centre for reforms, and collect, analyse and disseminate information on agricultural reforms   influence sector resource allocation to areas of highest impact  initiate major studies and policy developments within the agricultural sector  be accent for capacity building for all stakeholders involved or affected by the agricultural reform process * monitor implementation of asds activities.	n
18	medium scale farms range from 3 to 4 9 ha. farmers in this category are receptive to technology and practise commercial agriculture by investing in inputs, marketing produce and borrowing credit for farm development.	i
19	the cooperative movement has played an important role in agricultural development and in the economy. agricultural cooperatives have helped in procurement of inputs, production, value addition and marketing. in the financial sector the cooperative movement through savings and credit cooperatives sac cos has helped mobilize savings and provide credit to producers.	i
20	to contribute significantly to the development and growth of the agricultural sector, the role of the private sector in providing physical and social infrastructure, production, processing, input and output marketing, imports and exports, providing financial services and goods and services will need to be clearly defined. to facilitate effective participation, appropriate reforms in the legal and regulatory framework shall be instituted.	i
21	bilateral and multilateral donors have for many years financed kenyas agricultural budget. with the countrys increased financial capacity, the role of development partners has been reduced and governments own resources are now financing over 9 0 per cent of the agricultural budget. however, development partners continue to play an important role, particularly in spearheading new initiatives and carrying out pilot projects.	n
22	access to bank credit by farmers is still a major challenge despite the fact that kenya has a relatively well developed banking system. risks associated with agribusiness coupled with complicated land laws and tenure systems that limit the use of land as collateral make financing agriculture unattractive to the formal banking industry. in addition, corruption, political interference in the operations particularly of state owned banks, and a dysfunctional court system in the past, gave rise to a culture of defaulting that led to high numbers of non performing loans. this development forced many banks to charge their customers, who included farmers, prohibitively high interest rates to remain afloat. limited competition in the banking industry despite the large number of banks, also ensures interest rates remain high. the cost of bank credit and the limited number of banks in rural areas are some of the factors that make it difficult for farmers to access bank credit.	d
23	after independence, the government set up the agricultural finance corporation to provide long term credit to individuals and groups to purchase farms and to finance farm improvement, as well as seasonal credit for production. by providing suppliers with credit, cooperative societies also supported farmers. these organizations have been mismanaged and run down and are no longer important sources of finance for agriculture. indeed, a large number almost collapsed. today, farmers get credit mainly from cooperatives, ngos and community based lending institutions.	d
24	inadequate budgetary allocation. insufficient budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector is a key constraint. in 200 3 under the maputo declaration, african heads of state committed to allocate 1 0 per cent of their annual budgets to the agricultural sector. kenya has not yet achieved this target; by 200 8, the sector was receiving 4.5 per cent of the budget. this insufficient allocation has reduced human resources and service delivery by government institutions. reduced effectiveness of extension services. the effectiveness of extension services declined over the last two decades due to use of inappropriate methods and a sharp reduction in operational budgets and human resources in the sector ministries. in particular, livestock extension in asals has been underfinanced. while much has been achieved in the last 5 years, inadequate financial and human resources continue to constrain the sector.	d
25	are hard pressed to finance inputs and capital investment. a number of microfinance institutions are operating but they tend to increase the cost of credit, reach only a small proportion of smallholder farmers, and provide only short term credit. the formal banking system is just beginning to develop credit facilities particularly suited to smallscale farming.	d
26	 enhancing farmer access to affordable inputs and creditenhancing institutional efficiency and effectiveness in implementation and service delivery the current policy environment is not supportive of private sector led agricultural development. multiple and complex laws and regulations have evolved in the agricultural sector, which do not allow for investment in a liberalized economic environment. appropriate policies should provide for the changed role of government as a facilitator and regulator of agricultural activities.	d
27	the subsector will emphasize collecting, collating and disseminating information on domestic and international markets. the information will be disseminated to producers, exporters and service providers. global information networks will be developed through subscriptions to trade information systems and close collaboration with kenyas diplomatic service. to support an effective marketing strategy, the agriculture subsector will collaborate with other stakeholders in the public sector to facilitate private sector involvement in the development of marketing infrastructure, especially rural market facilities. farmer organizations will be supported and empowered to play their role in providing market support services.	n
28	kenya is a member of the world trade organization. this multilateral trade system aims to expand markets through liberalizing global trade. the agriculture sector will be a key player in multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations with the objectives of expanding and diversifying agricultural products and markets. regional markets, especially the  block, are now the major destination for kenyas exports. the subsector will collaborate with other relevant sectors and subsectors to promote economic cooperation and regional integration as a strategy for expanding local markets.	n
29	appropriate credit packages for small scale producers will be developed to facilitate access to key inputs. the subsector will enhance value addition technologies through building capacity of stakeholders, and providing material and financial support. these strategies are aimed at shifting the sector from subsistence agriculture to farming as a business.	i
30	producers. in collaboration with other stakeholders, the subsector will also support mobilization of financial resources through sac cos and other community based lending organizations to accelerate agricultural development.	i
31	the countrys agricultural resource base will be increased and improved through developing diversified, demand driven crop varieties; intensively applying appropriate technologies; and expanding use of irrigation systems in agricultural production. to achieve this research extension links will be strengthened to ensure demand driven research and effective application of research technologies on the farm. in addition, the private sector will be encouraged and supported to invest in agricultural production at all levels of the supply chain from farming, research and extension to processing and marketing. strengthening extension services and creating strong links between research and extension are two of the subsectors overriding objectives. effective adoption of technology packages will require a participatory approach to extension. the sector will strengthen its extension service delivery system and encourage private sector participation in the delivery of extension services, and will, in particular, empower farmer organizations and communities to provide these services at the grassroots.	n
32	the sector will also improve and strengthen support services to include access to appropriate and affordable credit, to production and market related information and to appropriate technologies, and improve its institutions such as agricultural training colleges, rural training development centres and agricultural training centres. the sector will work with the private sector and other agricultural sector ministries and agencies to make these support services available to farmers and service providers.	i
33	developing and operationalizing internal data management within the subsector and among the agricultural sector ministries and agencies will enhance efficiency in service delivery.	n
34	to increase agricultural productivity and improve farming as a business, farmers need access to inputs and credit. appropriate credit packages suitable for small scale producers will be made available to enable producers access key inputs such as fertilizer, agrochemicals and seed. farmers need capital investment for irrigation infrastructure, value addition technologies and general farm development, and to comply with food safety regulations.	i
35	reduce costs, promote local fertilizer blending and initiate the establishment of a national or regional manufacturing plant. to ensure the bulk fertilizer purchase programme is successfully implemented, the government will facilitate capacity building for farmers and enhance capacity of farmer institutions to purchase and distribute fertilizer efficiently.	i
36	this strategy will explore avenues for revitalizing livestock extension services in kenya. in particular, more resources will be committed to increase staffing levels towards the ratio of 1 livestock extension officer to 50 0 farmers in high potential areas, and 1 to 15 0 farmers in low potential areas to improve service delivery.	n
37	to improve access to markets, capacity building in the market value chain will be undertaken and infrastructure developed. in particular, organizing livestock producers into marketing groups, developing markets and supporting infrastructure including a livestock marketing information system will be addressed.	n
38	with international standards. international and regional markets are more lucrative than local markets and accessing them will increase returns.	n
39	an essential component of the asds is to enhance the capacity of the private and public sectors in agriculture through supporting innovative private sector activities or public private partnerships that promote market driven production, processing and marketing initiatives. this support will be actualized through the establishment of an innovation fund for agriculture and agribusiness ifaa. the objective of the fund will be to foster ass central objective of commercializing agriculture by catalyzing private sector participation in market oriented production and service delivery, promoting productivity and profitability or commercial viability of sector activities at all levels of the wider agricultural sector value chains.	i
40	the fund will target the semi commercial agribusiness or transitory level actors farmers, traders, processors, traders, agribusiness service providers. for purposes of the fund, semi commercial enterprise is defined as a business enterprise that is producing or offering a product or service for sale and fully for profit and or is at below the desired or optimum level of operation, but at the same time is neither capable of injecting all of the required additional resources  capital from own sources nor has the capacity to acquire required additional resources  capital from commercial sources.	i
41	cooperatives will be revitalized and their capacities strengthened to make them competitive. this will involve providing education and training, improving governance and management, enforcing legal provisions, adopting prudential standards, developing appropriate marketing strategies and operationalizing the regulatory framework for saccos. cooperatives will pursue business models that embrace innovation and modern technology transfer, and will adopt information and communication technology in their operations.	n
42	the cooperative subsector will implement the following interventions  reviewing cooperative development policy and legal framework  improving capacity for marketing agricultural inputs and produce  enhancing access to agricultural credit  promoting value addition  promoting internal and external trade  improving governance and management.	n
43	the cooperative marketing promotion component will focus on  enhancing the marketing capacity of the relevant subsector ministries * strengthening marketing capacity within cooperative societies.	n
44	equally important is the capacity of cooperatives to compete in a global marketing environment. capacity building for members, officials and staff will be enhanced through training and providing technical support, policy guidance, technology transfer and access to marketing information. mainstreaming marketing activities is core to business operations though currently, this function is peripheral. policy direction on cooperative marketing shall be spelt out to guide the cooperative subsector.	n
45	the main focus of sac cos is 1 to offer affordable financial services on a cost effective basis in order to cover a large number of cooperative members, 2 to provide an alternative system of securing credit. government should intervene to create a better environment for banks and the mainstream financial institutions to develop products that address farmers needs.	i
46	the competitiveness of kenyan produce has been undermined by inadequate infrastructure such as poor roads and railways that increase vehicular maintenance costs; high port and road charges and tariffs; and slow and outdated communications systems and infrastructure that impede the flow of market information. kenya is signatory to several trade protocols and agreements the east african community, the inter governmental authority on development igad, the common market for eastern and southern africa , the world trade organization wto, and the european union eu. kenya must take advantage of these opportunities provided by regional and international agreements to attain a certain level of global competitiveness. trade barriers that increase uncertainties and transaction costs will be removed to provide the private sector with the impetus to plan production, processing and marketing for external markets instead of producing solely for subsistence and internal markets.	n
47	opportunities are available to develop networks and partnerships between cooperative societies to reduce internal competition among them. some of the opportunities that will be explored include working with stakeholders to form joint ventures with the private sector, creating new initiatives such as cooperative private partnerships, getting direct investments in identified areas and working with the export processing zone authority to create export processing zones in areas with active cooperative societies.	n
48	the agro based private sector comprises both profit driven and not for profit civil society non state actors. such actors could be broadly categorized into farmer or producer organizations that include  primary producers individual farmers and producer companies, farmers producer groups, producer organizations, commodity based associations, farmer federations * various categories of cooperatives, agribusiness firms, individual entrepreneurs, cooperative societies, agricultural input dealers  agricultural commodity processors, packaging agents, transporters and warehousing agents * financial service providers microfinance institutions, commercial banks, saccos, and agribusiness development * technical and professional service providersextension, research, insurance, legal, consultancy, quality assurance and education, training, information  civilsociety, local and international ngos, faith based organizations, community based organizations, other resource mobilization organizations and opinion leaders the kenya private sector alliance keepsake is a coalition of private sector institutions such as business associations, federations and professional bodies. keepsake engages government in structured consultations and policy dialogue towards improving the business environment, accelerating transformation of public sector institutions, promoting private sector cultural change, facilitating growth through expansion of trade, improving productivity and competitiveness of enterprises, and supporting entrepreneurship and development of micro and small enterprises in line with the national development agenda. private sector issues are consolidated into one major agenda cutting across all sectors of the economy. individual organizations identify key priority areas and work together with the government to find practical solutions to issues.	n
49	in agriculture, the private sector constitutes beneficiaries and resource mobilizers to transform economic operations. it is the vehicle for requisite investments to transform agriculture towards increased productivity, agribusiness, and infrastructure development.	n
50	the private sector will continue working closely with the government to ensure services are delivered to producers and other players through the following interventions facilitating organization of smallholder producers at all levels developing and implementing a framework and instruments for strengthening institutional capacity of producer organizations fast tracking legal and regulatory reforms to promote private sector engagement promoting private sector participation in agro processing developing a mechanism for recognizing and supporting integrated innovation in agricultural value chains.	n
51	ifaa is a competitive grant fund to support agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry, wildlife and agribusiness initiatives at all levels of the value chain from production at farm level through value addition and marketing. the fund will support all subsectors of agriculture and agribusiness across all commodities.	i
52	although the government has increased the agricultural sector budget, it is unlikely to result in more investment in the sector. an agricultural development fund will be established and operationalized as a new mechanism for investing in the agricultural sector. it is anticipated that the fund will focus on strategic issues and areas stipulated in vision 203 0. the fund will cover areas that are outside the budgetary provisions of the mainstream sector ministries that are priority and offer high rates of return to investment.	i
53	 mobilize and increase financial resources, and create an appropriate financing system that will attract investment in the sector * increase government's financial allocation to the subsector to at least 2 per cent of the gdp annually * create an enabling environment for effective farmer organization and participation, and for other stakeholders to provide quality and cost effective support services  establish and promote a multi sectoral approach to sustainable irrigation and drainage development and management the subsector will accelerate the development of irrigation and drainage through financing the construction of major irrigation, drainage and flood control infrastructure. it will also adopt an integrated basin wide approach to irrigation planning and implementation to attain the vision 203 0 target of developing 3 2,00 0 ha per annum and 70 4,00 0 ha of new irrigation areas by 203 0.	i
54	the subsector will adopt a multi sectoral approach to irrigated agricultural production while encouraging and supporting the establishment of public private partnerships with the aim of contributing to development efforts through provision and delivery of services inputs, microfinance, technology, value adding, market outlets, etc.. the government will also mobilize funds from different sources to develop the subsector.	i
55	the government will also implement an effective institutional framework to ensure a coordination mechanism to facilitate multi sectoral development in the region.	n
56	2 an agreement relating to investment in community land shall only be made between the investor and the community.	n
57	2 2. 1 the kenya forestry research institute, as established under the science, technology and innovation act, 201 3, shall be the agency in forestry research and development.	n

61	5 4. 1 the cabinet secretary for the national treasury, may on the recommendation by the cabinet secretary, propose tax and other fiscal incentives to increase investments in forest land use and forest resource utilization in order to promote forest conservation and management, and to prevent or abate forest degradation.	i
62	in the context of climate change, technology transfer is defined as a broad set of processes covering the flows of know how, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change amongst different stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, nongovernmental organisations and research education institutions.	n
63	even though environmentally sound technology is a key means to achieving a climate resilient low carbon growth trajectory as well as technology transfer to developing countries being a major component of the , achievements in the area have been minimal. for this reason, it is obvious that technology development in both developed and developing countries, transfer to and diffusion in developing countries to help them meet sustainable development needs should be urgently accelerated. and provision of financial and other incentives for, scaling up of the development and transfer of technology to developing country parties in order to promote access to affordable environmentally sound technologies,ways to accelerate deployment, diffusion and transfer of affordable environmentally sound technologies,  cooperation on research and development of current, new and innovative technology, including win win solutions, andthe effectiveness of mechanisms and tools for technology cooperation in specific sectors.	i
64	as required under the , kenya undertook in 200 5 a technology needs assessment study that highlighted kenya's mitigation technological needs and the barriers to technology transfer to kenya. in view of this, the following section highlights some of the channels through which technology transfer to and within kenya may be achieved including throughthe kyoto protocols cdm or its future successor,accelerating south south transfer of technology,accelerating north south transfer of technology through foreign direct investment fdic including taking advantage of free patent technologies,development partner initiatives,establishment and capacity enhancement of local technological innovation centres which will help strengthen institutional technology generation and transfer through learning by doing approach,technology transfer within a future climate change agreement framework, andincluding climate change research and development in all budgets of ministries with substantial allocations to institutions of higher learning to strengthen research capacities.	i
65	the un report acting on climate change the un system delivering as one 200 8 identified undo as one of the un bodies through which coordination of the transfer of clean technology to the developing world can be facilitated. uni dos role as a host organisation for the cleaner production cp, which was created to foster environmentally sound production and consumption in developing countries, also makes it a suitable channel for transfer of technology. kenya has an active cleaner production centre, the kenya national cleaner production centre kncpc. some of the past and ongoing mitigation programmes of the knock include those in industrial energy management and cdm opportunities, as well as waste minimisation with tandem methane reduction, among others.	n
66	most climate friendly technologies have so far been developed and used in developed countries, from where they are expected to transfer to developing countries through well known channels including trade, foreign direct investment fdic and cross border technology licensing. in order to attract these technologies, the government needs to tackle barriers that have and continue to hinder fdic in the country. these include insufficient human capabilities, high transaction costs, trade and policy barriers as well as institutional limitations such as weak intellectual property protection laws and enforcement.	d
67	and adaptive innovation processes within developing countries facilitate the diffusion and development of technologies.*? this requires sufficient innovation capabilities amongst developing country firms, universities and research institutes, and appropriate links with public sector actors including production sectors.	n
68	it appears that a consensus is emerging on several elements of a future deal on a technology framework. notably, parties to the  seem likely to agree on the establishment of a technology body in the future climate change agreement, although the structure, mandate, name and funding of the proposed mechanism remain unclear. the creation of a technology body has been supported in particular by developing countries, specifically the g7 7 and china group, which proposed the establishment of a technology mechanism, comprising an executive body and a multilateral climate technology fund mctf, both subsidiary to the cop.	n
69	non governmental organisations have also supported the establishment of new institutions, with some proposing a mechanism dealing specifically with technology and others proposing a general mechanism for mitigation, adaptation, technology related measures and funding. the recent creation of a technology mechanism within the copenhagen accord, which is yet to be adopted, gives the strongest indication ever that such a mechanism will one day exist. kenya should place itself strategically   in terms of building the necessary capacities and identifying priority areas in which it can benefit from technology transfer through such a mechanism.	n
70	however, emca, 199 9 does not effectively address several climate change issues including e@ development of national inventories of anthropogenic emissions of ghg in kenya by source and removal of ghg by sinks,  national framework for carbon finance, e@ development of national and regional programmes to mitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by source,  promotion of education, training and awareness on climate change; appropriate technology transfer arrangements and their authorisation, and @ access to environmentally sound technologies.	n
71	within the doe, memr also established in 200 9 its national climate change coordinating office. this office now acts as the secretariat for the national climate change activities coordinating committee  established in 199 2 as a requirement under the . membership of the  is drawn from line ministries, academia and research institutions, non governmental organisations ngos as well as the private sector.	n
72	this office of the secretariat shall comprise key government agencies with policy and law related functions including the office of the attorney general and key ngos. it shall, in conjunction with nema, initiate all necessary policy, legal, strategy and planning processes, and promote and cooperate on legal information on matters related to climate change. this office shall also play a key role in international climate change negotiations, as well as work with other government agencies to phase out subsidies that contravene the objectives of the .	n
73	 coordinate and supervise ongoing cdm and other emissions reduction activities to ene facilitate fundraising for financial support, sure that they are in line with and biotechnology transfer and provisions for acute towards meeting the county's environmental building, and men and sustainable development goals as well as vision 203 0,  recommend joint action involving both the public and private sectors in order to moe@ establish and maintain a project database bilious the necessary finance and accelerate and keep track of emerging, proposed and redd actions.	n
74	in addition, the strategy has established that institutions currently in place to govern climate change affairs are inadequate. it has consequently recommended a dedicated and adequately funded climate change secretariat be established within the ministry of environment and mineral resources to oversee climate change issues including the implementation of the adaptation and mitigation programmes and the other aspects of the national climate change response strategy. this institution, including the proposed structures within it see chapter 8, should be anchored on the provisions of the new climate change laws to be enacted.	n
75	the table on the next  shows that significant additional financial resources need to be mobilised for the implementation of this strategy with every effort made to reallocate the countrys budgetary resources and raise additional revenue for this purpose. nevertheless, most of the funding will be mobilised from developed countries either directly or indirectly through the multilateral financial institutions and the un agencies. timely establishment of the proposed climate change finance facility is therefore critical.	i
76	moreover, because there are few climate change specialists in the areas of science, policy, adaptation, mitigation and carbon finance and markets it is important to put in place a targeted capacity building framework. building the capacity of local communities to help them adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change as well as take opportunities such as those offered by the reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation redd mechanisms is also important. kenya will undertake various interventions to address its capacity needs by strengthening vulnerability analysis and food security monitoring, supporting the modernisation of the kenya meteorological department, strengthening institutions in charge of disaster risk reduction drr, the national designated authority dna amongst other interventions discussed further in chapter 6.	n
77	further, efforts should be made to support technology generation and absorption. this can be done by building the capacity of relevant institutions to enable them undertake research & development r&d in climate change related fields as well as through technology transfer from the industrialised countries to kenya. to this end, the strategy has identified some of the channels through which technology development, absorption and diffusion can be achieved, which include e@ through the kyoto protocol's cdm or its future successor, e@ through the united nations industrial development organization unido,accelerating south south partnerships,accelerating north south transfers through foreign direct investment fdic including taking advantage of patent free technologies,establishment and capacity enhancement of local technological innovation centres which will help strengthen institutional technology generation and transfer through learning by doing approach, and e@ including climate change research and development in all budgets of ministries with substantial allocations to institutions of higher learning to strengthen research capacities.	n
78	the purpose of the resource mobilisation plan is to ensure proposed programmes and projects are fully implemented. the plan targets domestic resources from both local and national government as well as from the private sector. in addition to international funding agencies such as the world bank and international monetary fund imf, the mobilisation plan also covers external resources from development partners and regional funding agencies such as multilateral development banks eg. the african development bank afdb. the plan covers a duration of 2 0 years, coinciding with the countrys vision 203 0 and the initial five years coinciding with the millennium development goals mfg fulfilment.	i
79	prior to establishing a significant funding source for climate change adaptation and mitigation e.g. from the recently created finance mechanism under the copenhagen accord there is a need for national governments to establish a coordinated strategy and operational capacity for accessing this fund. for mitigation specifically cdm, a designated national agency is required, and guidelines are available on what is expected. this is not the same for adaptation.	i
80	currently, discussions in the adaptation fund board include the nature of entities that would qualify for funding, the role of national coordination, and capabilities required for monitoring, reporting and verification. even though the form of a national adaptation strategic and implementing entity has not yet been elaborated in the , an entity such as a national adaptation facility fan will be necessary in future. a national adaptation facility or authority should therefore be established to enable mobilisation and consolidation of resources from multiple sources. in developing such a capacity, there are many options that must be based on the unique structures of national government and civil society. the term authority is open in that where a cross sectoral, multi stakeholder capacity is required it might involve a single authority or agency or a multi party structure with operational capacity that might be termed facility; hub or partnership it will also require consultative and governing structures i.e. advisory committee, council, board, governing body and funding will be vital to its success. a pilot fund is suggested for gearing up a broad effort, preparing sound project proposals and mobilising stakeholder engagement. the fan should be anchored on a national policy and legal framework that sets out the key aims and processes with the policy framework then translated into sectoral objectives, targets and performance indicators. while all sectors and regions will be exposed to climate change, early action should be focused with the strategy recognising regional requirements and the urgent needs of vulnerable socioeconomic groups.	i
81	a multi stakeholder financial facility for mobilising early actions on adaptation and learning may be a desirable feature of the national adaptation facility. such a pilot fund would not supplant the larger stream of funding from national budgets or international projects. the governance of the facility will need to consider effective decision making for rapid responses, accountability and representation of multiple stakeholders, transparency in allocating funds as well as effective reporting to enable an analysis of what works.	i
82	the kyoto protocol has set the world towards a low carbon growth path. one of the main outcomes is the carbon market, an international market regime of three flexible mechanisms designed and created to tackle climate change cost effectively and assist with sustainable development. two of these mechanisms   the clean development mechanism cdm and the joint implementation hi   are project based. the cdm and hi were created under articles 1 2 and 6 of the protocol, respectively. they are designed to help reduce ghg emissions through project activities involving inter alias renewable energy including fuel switching, energy efficiency, reforestationafforestation, and low emission public transportation, and more. the cdm is relevant to kenya as it applies to non annex 1 countries, which are developing countries that have undertaken to tackle climate change, but are not obliged to take on legally binding ghg emission reduction targets.	n
83	established in 200 1 under decision 7 of cop7 decision7cp.7 to finance projects relating to adaptation, technology transfer and capacity building, energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry, waste management, and economic diversification in non annex 1 countries. the fund is not dedicated to adaptation activities, although adaptation remains the key priority. kenyas project on adaptation to climate change in arid lands  funded by the world bank is one of the first scoff projects. also in the pipeline for kenya is the adaptation to climate change and health project to be funded by scoff and channelled through the world health organization who and undp.	i
84	the only fund strictly dedicated to adaptation is the adaptation fund af. this fund was established under article 1 2.8 of the kyoto protocol and decision 1 0 of cop 7 decision 1 0 cp.7 to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing country parties that are parties to the kyoto protocol, as well as activities identified in paragraph 8 of decision 5cp.7 such activities include water resources management, land management, agriculture, health, infrastructure development, fragile ecosystems including mountainous ecosystems and integrated coastal zone management. the af revenue is to be derived from voluntary contributions and an international levy of two percent of certified emission reductions certs from cdm projects, which is known as the 'share of proceeds. during 200 8 201 2, the adaptation fund generated us$ 8 0 30 0 million a year.	i
85	in general, the three funds lcdf, scoff and af are not adequate to fund the massive adaptation needs of developing countries, many of which are already being ravaged by climate change. at present, the funds mainly constitute pledges by donor countries and agencies. as history shows pledges do not always lead to actual delivery and implementation of the funds. again, even with the pledges included, the funds still fall short of the us$ 10 0 billion per annum which developed countries have pledged to mobilise under the copenhagen accord to help address climate change needs of developing countries by 202 0. in any case, even this proposed figure is considered by many as a gross underestimate because it is based on a scenario where the global temperature increase would be limited to 2c, whilst some climate models show that current emissions pathway leads us to a much warmer world 3c and upward and consequently higher costs.	i
86	activities identified in the action plan require substantial additional and adequate financial resources for their implementation, and funding is therefore required from both internal and external sources. given the importance of adaptation, it is recommended that the kenyan government create a multi stakeholder national adaptation facility fan for mobilising resources for adaptation activities.	i
87	all stakeholders should mainstream climate proofing and climate change responsive activities in their programmes and projects. in achieving this, most line ministries particularly those offering development and infrastructural services have developed climate change response programmes and projects, which form and are included in the action plan of this strategy.	n
88	while kenya stands to benefit immensely from the advanced technology of developed countries, efforts should be made to support local technology generation and application through institutional capacity building programmes. consequently new and additional resources are needed to support kenya's research, development as well as strengthen academic institutions together we can tackle climate change	n
89	identify specific research and development needs to address climate change, and opportunities for technology development, absorption and diffusion this will be achieved by an individual sector analysis of the knowledge and technology gaps that need to be addressed in the short, medium and long term. in addition, in order to foster faster transfer and adoption of climate friendly and resilient technologies in kenya for sustainable development, the strategy will seek to recommend avenues through which the transfer of such technologies can take place.	n
90	appropriate national climate change entity to undertake and oversee climate change activities in the country. e@ provide an action plan and ensure its implementation in terms of having a robust monitoring and evaluation framework the identified adaptation and mitigation activities will require the mobilisation of additional and substantial financial resources for their implementation. an action plan and a resource mobilisation plan will help achieve this. in addition, monitoring and evaluation activities will play an important role in ensuring an effective implementation of the project activities identified in the nccrs. there is need for an efficient, focused and dynamic implementation framework and a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. this objective will ensure that such measures are in place.	n
91	however, the vision 203 0 does not address climate change adequately, but it does refer to climate change adaptation in the context of building capacity as part of environmental management. one of the specific aims stated under environmental management is the goal to attract at least five clean development mechanisms cdm projects per year in the next five years.	n
92	climate change also presents opportunities for developing countries like kenya, which can avoid the high emission path that developed countries have pursued to attain their present high economic status. the carbon market, where it is possible to trade carbon credits, presents an opportunity for developing countries to raise additional revenues for ghg emission reducing projects that also contribute to sustainable development. there are two types of carbon markets and both are relevant to kenya. the two markets arethe clean development mechanism cdm compliance market under the kyoto protocol and ii voluntary carbon markets vcm, which emerged to fulfil the demand from organisations and businesses that wish to offset their carbon emissions voluntarily. it should be noted that presently, most developing countries in africa have not benefited from carbon markets because of their complexity, trading conditions, investments and general lack of capacity and knowledge in developing countries. therefore, for kenya to benefit from these markets, intense capacity building particularly at the community level will be required.	i
93	specific recommendations that can enable kenya to benefit from redd opportunities includerobust monitoring, reporting and verification mirv institutional arrangements clear credible national forest monitoring baselines and guidelines,filling the historical data gaps on forest cover throughout the country,addressing the risk of non permanence and leakage as a necessary condition for any parties or entities to participate in a redd mechanism and activities,assistance with methodology development especially on redd, which has the potential to not only mitigate climate change but also support livelihoods, maintain vital ecosystem services, and preserve globally significant biodiversity,need for financial support, technology transfer and provision for capacity building especially | among forest dependent communities, and= joint action involving both the public and private sectors in order to mobilise the necessary finance and accelerate redd actions.	i
94	key issues that have continued to shape the global climate change regime are also explained in this chapter of the strategy. these include mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, governance as well as the role of land use and land use change and forestry  in climate change mitigation especially in developing countries.	n
95	that are easy to understand and use. there is need to have well developed ict infrastructure and skills to facilitate effective dissemination of climate change information and education. the government should develop a website on climate change issues and all the relevant information, programmes, projects, related to climate change and establish one stop resource centres which should be equipped with climate change material,  dissemination of credible and reliable climate change information and research findings the government should put in place strategic planning and public review processes to facilitate credible fact finding on a key climate science issues,comprehensive climate and ecosystem observing and data management systems, andthe development of decision support resources,  supporting public debate on climate change issues by promoting parliamentary public hearings, participatory policymaking initiatives at both central and local level, and a vibrant civil society, and  developing a comprehensive communications plan the government needs to develop a comprehensive communications implementation plan and funding plan, based on an inventory of existing communication activities and building on experience from several short term pilot projects to determine and shape ongoing effective communication strategies.	n
96	in view of the risks and opportunities presented by climate change, enhanced capacity building is required to strengthen capability of developing countries like kenya which have very few climate change specialists in the areas of science, policy, adaptation, mitigation carbon trading and carbon markets. therefore, it is important to put in place a targeted capacity building framework, and build the capacity of local communities to help them adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. further, the actions being recommended in the strategy will require people with adequate necessary skills to implement.	n
97	in line with the uns acting on climate change, the un system delivering as one report, the following are as some of the key critical areas for kenya where capacity building should be targetedregional and sub regional preparatory workshops for climate change negotiators where kenya would participate with other developing countries, sids and ldcs, on the  negotiation process,technical and policy support to kenya as a party to the  for preparing its national communications,  support to the country in its efforts to implement  decisions through country driven approaches,  awareness raising, development of communication tools, training and planning workshops at local, national, regional and global levels,  capacity building and support for the modernisation and development of national meteorological services e.g. the kenya meteorological department and gad climate prediction and applications centre icpac,mobilising and enhancing the capacity of the government, employers and workers organisations to contribute to coherent policies and effective programmes leading to greening economies with green jobs, 4 6 0 2 emissions from fuel combustion only. emissions are calculated using ideas energy balances and the revised 199 6 ipecac guidelines. also, see chapter 4 under mitigation for ghg emission trends together we can tackle climate change	n
98	  providing a role for national leadership in international policy dialogue e.g. for the national adaptation platform, mainstreaming disaster risk reduction err and adaptation e.g. putting measures to reduce poverty and empower marginal communities through   tackling underlying _vulnerability poverty as detailed by the vision 203 0 especially important for slow onset disasters,   mainstreaming risk and adaptation within the government plans and budgets,   using the development of a national adaptation platform as a tool to mainstream climate change adaptation, initiate systematic development programmes and enhance national partnership with un agencies,   investing in climate proofing development agenda and increasing awareness of err in projects,   investing in local adaptive capacity e.g. invest in projects that protect livelihood assets like special water management projects in arid lands which could facilitate cross   sectoral and multi scale coordination, promoting flexibility in approaches to disaster risk management through   regularly updating risk plans and information,   decentralising responsibilities and skills,   ensuring community _ participation e.g. through skills sharing forums initiatives, and creating financial mechanisms for disaster management and invest in regional partnerships through   the use of the national disaster management policy to facilitate the introduction of disaster trust funds, risk transfer mechanisms and formal donor partnerships,   building on regional partnerships to share costs and expertise, and pool resources at the district level with the engagement of ngos, private sector and government special projects, if necessary through regulation,   investing in institutional capacity building, collaborative projects and networks to increase awareness on international funding and strengthen links with development banks and donor agencies,   the use of international funding opportunities e.g. from the gee to fund large scale adaptation projects. assisting kenya to improve its level of participation in the cdm, and supporting the identification of policy options that enable the rural poor to engage in climate change mitigation by building the foundation for pro poor payment for ecosystem service markets. supporting education, training, information exchange, best practices and national strategy initiatives related to the development and applications of access to stateof the art climate friendly technologies, creation of regional networks of climate change focal points in governments to promote exchange of experience and knowledge on technology transformation, training programmes and capacity building together we can tackle climate change	i

101	infrastructure the second mtp will build on successes of the first mtp. new investments will include cheaper and adequate electricity; local and regional rail and road networks that provide safe, efficient and cost effective transport; adequate water for households and industry; affordable quality housing and sustainable environmental management. industrialisation the kenyan economy is still reliant primarily on agriculture and services. the growing consumer demand for manufactured goods has been met mainly by imports. the government will facilitate growth of the manufacturing sector; make agriculture competitive and diversify the economy for employment creation. the government will also support local entrepreneurs to increase their share in local and external markets through better supply chain and making local enterprises more price competitive in order to serve a growing local, regional and continental market. improved trade the country will focus on expanding trade to increase its share in the fast expanding regional and other emerging markets. trade in the broader region will be backed by joint infrastructural investments with neighboring countries. during the plan period, the government will facilitate research in business development and entrepreneurship under a new entity called sharia kenya to provide funding and leverage investment from local banks. this will develop capacity and productivity of local manufacturing geared to competitively priced quality exports to africa and the global market.	i
102	investment to support growth the strategies in the second mtp are designed to increase investment to gdp ratio by investing prudently in key sectors. land reforms and registration will be undertaken to make land a productive asset. in addition, new initiatives will be undertaken to encourage the financial sector mobilize savings and improve resource allocation to key growth sectors.	i
103	competitiveness and rebalancing growth to make kenya globally competitive, the government will increase investment in expansion, development and modernisation of roads, rail, ports, ict and telecommunications in order to make kenya a top logistics hub. in addition, priority will be given to development of the lamu port, southern sudan and ethiopia transport  corridor and the oil, gas and other mineral resources sector to spur higher economic growth. priority will also be given to implementing the national ict master plan 201 2 201 7, and the implementation of reforms to improve world bank. the opp act will be operationalized to facilitate private sector investment in infrastructure in order to enhance efficiency and competitiveness of the economy.	i
104	governance and public financial management reforms the public financial management act 201 2 will be implemented with the aim of exercising controls in public spending and improving the quality of public expenditure through full implementation of the integrated public financial management systems miffs at national and county levels. further training of public officials involved in budgeting and expenditure at both levels of government will be undertaken. reforms in public financial management will be guided by transparency, cost efficiency better delivery of public services, and accountability to the public on taxation and the use of public funds.	i
105	the second mtp will integrate the sdgs for the post 201 5 which includeending extreme poverty and hunger;achieve development and prosperity for all without ruining the environment;ensure learning for all children and youth;achieving gender equality and reduce inequalities;achieve health and well being at all ages;increasing agricultural production in an environmentally sustainable manner, to achieve food security and rural prosperity;make cities productive and environmentally sustainable;curb human induced climate change with sustainable energy;protect ecosystems and ensure sound management of natural resources; andimprove governance and align business behavior with all the goals. during the second mtp period and beyond, measures will be taken to realign kenyas foreign policy with the nations international trade objectives. these include more training of staff in trade analysis and negotiation techniques, deepening economic and commercial diplomacy, regional integration, bilateral and multilateral partnerships to increase market share in traditional export destinations, penetration of new markets in emerging economies as well as enhancing the role of private sector in regional integration initiatives. additionally, the realigned foreign policy will link regional peace and security with kenyas economic and commercial diplomacy interests and ensure the diplomatic presence in all african region and new emerging economies. kenyas foreign policy shall also be directed towards promoting nairobi as a diplomatic centre, international economic hub, and venue for multi lateral diplomacy.	n
106	youth enterprise fund the sub sector will seek to review the funds product and services, re brand and re launch the youth enterprise fund.	i
107	these factors contributed to low attainment of projected gdp growth, and investment and savings targets. in addition, the slow implementation of key economic reforms, such as the policy and legal framework for public private partnerships pops enacted at the end of the plan period, and absence of legislative framework for establishment of special economic zones partly explains the missed sectoral investment and growth targets in agriculture, industry and service sectors of the economy.	d
108	the realignment of kenyas foreign policy and international relations is expected to promote and diversify kenyas economic partnerships and trade. this will boost economic growth by targeting alternative markets including those in the african region.	n
109	on the domestic front, kenya is implementing major legal and institutional reforms that will provide a better environment for sustained macro economic stability and improved management of public resources. these include the public finance management act 201 2; the county governments act 201 2; the urban areas and cities act 201 1, national government coordination act 201 3, and transition to devolved governments act 201 2. in addition, the government is continuing to deepen reforms in the judiciary, police and land sectors. these reforms will enhance administration of justice, governance, law and order, and provide the country with a more conducive environment for doing business, promote investment, growth and employment creation. foreign direct investment is expected to increase especially following the recent discovery of oil, gas, rare earth minerals and coal. in addition, the country will maximize its geographical comparative advantage through implementation of the  corridor project, modernisation of the port of mombasa, construction of a standard gauge railway from mombasa to malaba, and expansion of homo kenyatta international airport to serve as the regional airport hub. construction of the ethiopia power interconnectivity line, to source cheaper hydropower, and completion of the solaria iv by 201 4 and other geothermal energy projects are also expected to boost growth through supply of cheaper and reliable power.	n
110	the growth strategy will also benefit from exploitation of green growth opportunities such as the use of carbon credits especially in reforested catchment towers, clean energy use in geothermal, hydro, wind and solar power, the promotion of natural products initiatives, promotion of resource efficiency and clean production systems. during the plan period, the 4 7 counties are also expected to attract investment and emerge as regional growth hubs.	i
111	services sector is expected to grow from about 6.5 per cent in 201 3 to about 1 0 per cent by 201 7. the sector will benefit from sustained growth in tourism, ict, and related businesses such as business process outsourcing bpos, and expansion of regional trade and transport services. in addition, the financial sector is expected to expand rapidly as business confidence improves and as new strategies to boost savings are implemented. the establishment of the financial services center during the plan period is expected to further improve the sectors growth, and to attract more local and international firms in the sector.	n
112	the government will pursue prudent macroeconomic policies to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability. the debt to gdp ratio is projected to decline to 3 9.2 per cent by 201 7201 8 from 4 3.9 per cent in 201 31 4. the implementation of the contributory pension scheme for public servants the public service superannuation act, 201 2 will enhance domestic savings and reduce government contingent liabilities. tax reforms will be given priority including enhancing compliance and broadening the tax base. these will be supported through the implementation of integrated tax management system its and revamping enforcement mechanisms.	i
113	the government will continue to borrow from domestic and external sources with the latter being largely on concessional terms and will aim at a 3 07 0 ratio of domestic to external financing. this will ensure that the private sector is not crowded out in the credit market and that government projects are financed at lower costs. the government will also issue a debut sovereign bond at the international markets within the second mtp period. this bond will primarily finance infrastructure development in the country, help the government diversify its investor base, establish a pricing benchmark for future issuance by both the public and private sector, and promote kenyas reputation and visibility in the international investor community.	i
114	as part of the employment creation strategy, the government willinitiate labour intensive public works programs;facilitate establishment of special economic zones and industrial parks; andexploit green employment opportunities in organic products industries, organic farming, resource efficient and clean production, renewable energy, forestry, environmental planning and urban waste management. over the plan period, rationalisation of the public service will continue. the government aims at an efficient, effective and accountable public service that will adopt innovative ways to deliver public services including leveraging on ict.	n
115	note employment targets were based on the 200 1 201 1 elasticity defined as per cent increase in employment level for every one per cent increase in gdp levels as follows agriculture 0.4 3; industry 0.5 0; and services 0.7 5 source ministry of devolution and planning, the national treasury provide a framework and necessary guidance on wage levels, wage formation and adjustment mechanisms and other wage administration issues to reduce incidences of industrial disputes. kenyas global ranking on the world banks ease of doing business indicators fell from 72 nd position in 200 8 to 121 st position in 201 2. the government is committed to reversing this trend, and the overall goal is to ensure that by the end of the plan period the country rank among the top 5 0 countries in the both ease of doing business ranking and the world economic forums global competitiveness index. the government will, thus speed up implementation of structural and institutional reforms and put in place the necessary enabling legislation in all sectors to enhance efficiency and competitiveness and investment.	i
116	implementation of the strategy for public finance management reforms fmri 201 3 201 8 will enhance transparency and accountability for improved service delivery. the public procurement and disposal act, 200 5 will be reviewed to address procurement bottlenecks and build capacity at the national and county government levels. ict initiatives such as the re engineered ifmis, nimes, e promis, and e government will be fast tracked and cascaded to the devolved government level to ensure faster project implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.	n
117	to improve the quality of data, the following surveys and censuses will be carried out within the period of the second mtplabour force survey;census of business establishments ; andgeneration of county statistical profiles. tax reforms are key to enhancing the government's revenue capacity to finance development programmes and projects. kenya revenue authority ark will continue to benchmark its services to the standards of selected upper middle income countries so as to meet the international best practices.	n
118	the realisation of the objectives and targets of the second mtp hinges on successful implementation of the enablers or foundations. these include infrastructure roads, rail network, sea ports airports and pipeline; information communication and technology ict; science technology and innovation st&l; land reforms; human resource development, labour and employment; security; public sector reforms; national values and ethics; and ending drought emergencies ede. this chapter outlines the policies, programmes and projects planned for implementation during the plan period.	n

120	in line with the priorities outlined in the jubilee coalition manifesto agenda for kenya 201 3 1 7 and beyond the plan aims at accelerating economic growth putting the economy on a higher, inclusive and sustainable growth trajectory leading to a double digit gdp growth rate within the five year period. to realize these goals and secure our countrys prosperity, the government will in the course of this plan period implement measures to strengthen our economic competitiveness through accelerated governance and public sector reforms and by increasing government spending on expansion, and modernisation of our railways, roads, ports, airports, energy, water and the ict and telecommunications infrastructure. to further enhance efficiency and competitiveness of our economy, the government will devote more investment to infrastructure and to the key sectors of the economy that will drive growth particularly through public private partnerships arrangements.	n
121	the jubilee government was elected into office on a platform that prioritises job creation and increasing youth employment over the plan period and expanding kenyas area under irrigation in order to increase agricultural productivity and food security. the policy mechanisms for realizing these objectives are contained in this medium term plan. a commercialized agriculture with high value addition remains our key priority. at the same time, the government will establish disease free zones in our livestock producing areas, working in cooperation with the county governments concerned, to support higher productivity and processing of animal products for domestic consumption and exports. similar efforts will be made to increase value addition and employment in fisheries and in the exploitation of our rich marine resource. in order to meet the goals of job creation, value addition in agriculture, fisheries and livestock, and export diversification, the government will, therefore, establish special economic zones in partnership with private investors to support increased manufacturing and exports with high value added. to meet the demand for skilled jobs in these and other sectors, priority will also be accorded to programmes targeting training and apprenticeships to meet the demand for human resource skills required by the transformation of the kenya economy which is central to this medium term plan. as the education and training sections of this plan demonstrate, this will be accomplished through a variety of programmes under the social pillar. the government will also strengthen youth employment and entrepreneurship through credit, financial assistance and training. this will enable recipients to acquire skills and engage in productive employment on their own or as suppliers to the larger enterprises in the public or private sectors.	n
122	coordination of the technology, innovation and commercialisation programme the government will implement knowledge management information system kmis, innovative technology transfer system and undertake science, technology and innovation indicators surveys that will include development and adoption of kenyan common science, technology and innovation indicators and establishment of an african sch observatory.	n
123	performance contracting and performance appraisal systems. other reforms focused on transformative leadership, structured stakeholder engagement, public financial management, and mainstreaming gender and disability issues.	n

126	transfer pricing to prevent loss of revenue and foreign exchange through transfer pricing the authority will review the governance structure of the transfer pricing programme, enhance the transfer pricing risk assessment, implement an alternative dispute resolution strategy, build up the authority third party information base and sources and strengthen tax information exchange agreements and partnerships.	i
127	implement the strategy for taxation of mining sector the increasing activities in the mining sector are a pointer to the potential of the sector to contribute substantially to the economy and government revenue. this follows the recent discovery of various mineral resources in the country. ark will put in place the requisite mechanisms and framework to collect increased revenue from this emerging sector.	i
128	restructuring of the kenya foreign service institute the foreign service institute, established in 200 7, will be transformed to a foreign service academy and semi autonomous government agency in order to tackle the increasingly complex international and regional diplomatic processes. it will also enhance the skills and knowledge of members of the foreign service, making them more professional, effective and able to perform a variety of tasks.	n
129	government in consultation with county governments will formulate a policy framework that will guide performance of public service institutions.	n
130	the national sports lottery fund the fund will provide a tool for raising funds targeting sports development. the lottery fund will have the potential to inject more than ksh50 0 million into the sports budget annually. the funds raised will be used for development of the less developed sports in the country to increase the diversity and to supplement the budgets of major sports events. in addition, the funds will be used to train the necessary technical personnel, increase the award scheme to enhance competitiveness of the countrys sports men and women.	i
131	implementing devolution is a theme that runs through this medium term plan. the plans political pillar outlines measures to support devolution and the legislation that will be enacted to implement it as required by the constitution. the government is committed to supporting devolution with financial and human resources and in building capacity within county governments. the plan is also committed to the continued implementation of the judicial transformation framework, and to widen access to justice for all kenyans. the government believes that justice and observation of human rights are integral parts of improving governance and the rule of law. over the five year plan period, the government will therefore expand, equip and modernize the security agencies to ensure that every kenyan is assured of his or her safety and that of their property. improved security will also contribute to a better environment for doing business in kenya, bring in more international tourists, and investment into our country. the pay and conditions of service for security personnel will be improved and measures will be put in place to support community policing and invest in cctv and other technology to improve security.	n
132	foreign employment management, orientation and re entry programmes the government will develop orientation and re entry programmes to prepare and sensitize kenyan immigrants on the nature of jobs abroad, their terms and conditions; the rights, obligations and remedies of the workers in case of violations; and pre departure preparations for the job seekers. guidelines on employment of foreigners and on registration and accreditation of private employment agencies will be developed reviewed and enforced. the government will also enter into bilateral agreements with key labour destination countries. transformation of the national social security fund nsf to a pension scheme the nsf will be transformed into a social insurance pension scheme. the transformation will seek to increase coverage of the nssf, improve adequacy of benefits provided by the nssf, provide benefits in the form of pension, retain a link between benefits and contributions with the benefits largely being determined on a defined contribution basis, and ensure sustainability and affordability of social security.	n

210	rainfed production will be encouraged for emerging high value, drought tolerant crops such as jatropha, melia, indigenous fruits, medicinal species, gum arabic and resins. in addition, research in and adoption of drought tolerant crop varieties such as cotton, sisal, sorghum, millet and pigeon peas will be promoted.	n
211	kenyas various habitats and ecosystemsforests, grasslands, wetlands, coral reefs and mangroves are biodiversity hotspots. most of the countrys biodiversity is also found within protected areas, which make up these habitats and ecosystems.	n
212	the country is home to over 650 0 plant species; 26 0 are found nowhere else in the world. with more than 100 0 bird species and over 35 0 mammal species, kenya ranks second highest among african countries in species richness for these animal groups. over time, the country has lost some of her well known biodiversity resources mainly due to population increase, habitat destruction, desertification, over exploitation of species, and conversion through deforestation and drainage of wetlands for agriculture and settlement. .	n
213	agricultural wastes can be in the form of liquids, slurries or solids. the major components of these wastes are biodegradable. however, they also contain components such as nitrogen, human and animal pathogens, medicinals, feed additives, salts, and certain metals that under uncontrolled conditions are harmful to aquatic, plant, animal, or human life. in rural areas, the most common method of disposing of these wastes is by applying them to the land. hazards to humans occur either directly via water or indirectly via crops and animals fed or grazing on the crops. use of these wastes as animal feed can also be a pathway.	n
214	has been found that sometimes the by products could be more valuable than the main products. while in kenya no major crises have been associated with hazardous materials in agricultural solid wastes, the potential for problems should not be underestimated. discharge of agricultural and industrial chemicals into water bodies or disposing of them on land masses is killing ecosystems. the use of mercury to form amalgam during gold processing around lake victoria is gradually polluting the various rivers flowing into the lake with mercury, as is evidenced by the accumulation of the mineral in fish.	n
215	pesticide use in urban and peri urban production of crops and animals carries serious risks. these households make regular use of highly toxic pesticides not necessarily related to pest type or pest pressure, often near densely populated areas. urban households are also vulnerable to other contaminants. farmers take advantage of the nutrients in urban and peri urban wetlands, sewage disposal areas and dumpsites to plant food crops. these areas contain heavy metals and pathogens, and the air around is generally heavily polluted.	n
216	arising from the economic exploitation of resources in the regions, and low levels of development in various regions resulting in high incidence of poverty.	n
217	while most wildlife is concentrated in protected areas, there is a considerable population in areas surrounding farmlands and ranches. wildlife play a key role in the national economy through tourism. however, game in farmland and ranches is seen as a menace resulting in conflict between wildlife and humans. there is significant potential to exploit these resources through game ranches and conservation areas and to rear some special wild animals such as ostriches and crocodiles.	n
218	to encompass ecosystem processes on which wildlife populations depend. an increase in wildlife populations can result in pressure that degrades park ecosystems. limited park sizes and confined wildlife populations are inimical to the survival of species at the edges of protected areas, especially where land use in the adjacent areas is incompatible with conservation.	n
219	human health is important as it affects the labour force involved in agricultural activities. the most devastating impact of human health on agriculture is epidemics and pandemics such as malaria, hiv and aids and zoonoses.	n
220	productivity. productivity levels for many crops are below potential and for some agricultural produce yield and value over a 5 year period have either remained constant or are on the decline. similarly, the production level for most fish and livestock products is below potential. forest cover and tree productivity have been on the decline while population growth has led to increased human wildlife conflict.	n
221	cent of the countrys population. most of the food and cash crops as well as livestock are produced in this zone under semi intensive and intensive systems. the zone accounts for all the tea, pyrethrum, potato, coffee, vegetables and nearly 7 5 per cent of milk production.	n
222	the medium rainfall zone receives between 75 0 mm and 100 0 mm of rainfall annually and occupies between 3 0 and 3 5 per cent of the countrys land area. it is home to about 3 0 per cent of the population. farmers keep cattle and small stock and grow drought tolerant crops. there is significant migration of the population from the densely populated high rainfall zone to the medium rainfall zone.	n
223	low rainfall areas receive 20 0 75 0 mm of rainfall annually. these areas are home to about 2 0 per cent of the population, 8 0 per cent of the countrys livestock and 6 5 per cent of the wildlife.	n
224	kenya has two agricultural production systems rain fed and irrigated agriculture.	n
225	kenyas agriculture is mainly rainfed and is entirely dependent on the bimodal rainfall in most of the country. there are two cropping seasons except in the very high altitude areas.	n
226	suitable. however, there is a relatively high risk of crop failure due to increased frequency of dry spells and an uneven rainfall distribution. increasing productivity in these areas will require better selection of crops, adoption of improved technologies, and better crop husbandry.	n
227	crop production is in two categories based on the use of the harvested produce food crops and cash  industrial crops.	n
228	53 1,80 0 tonnes, while roots and tubers increased from 1.1 million tonnes to 1.8 million tonnes over the same period. however, the production of other food crops, particularly legumes and root crops, declined due to a combination of factors such as the effects of heavy rains, pests and diseases, and lack of quality planting material.	n
229	the main industrial crops are tea, coffee, sugar cane, cotton, sunflower, pyrethrum, barley, tobacco, sisal, coconut and bixa, all of which contribute 5 5 per cent of agricultural exports.	n
230	declines were recorded in several crops. pyre thrum recorded an average decline of 1 3 per cent. sugar cane is a major cash crop whose performance declined. kenya produces about 40 0,00 0 tonnes of raw sugar annually while annual consumption is 60 0,00 0 tonnes, which necessitates importation to meet the demand. the main producers of sugar cane are smallholder farmers in nyanza, western and rift valley provinces. local sugar cannot compete with imported sugar because of high production costs. this poses a major threat to the local sugar industry and the five million people that it supports.	n
231	other commercial crops whose production has remained low despite large unexploited potential are cotton, pyrethrum, oil crops, cashewnut, bia and sisal.	n
232	the key livestock subsectors are beef, dairy, sheep, goats, camel, poultry, piggery and emerging livestock.	n
233	the beef cattle population is estimated at 9 million. the main beef species are east african zebu, boran, wallahs and cross breeds. although most beef is produced from rangelands, dairy cattle culls contribute substantially to the national supply. on average, the country produces 32 0,00 0 tonnes annually of beef worth kes 6 2.1 billion. however, beef production is affected by climate variability and animal diseases.	n
234	sheep and goats play a key role in pastoral households food security and incomes owing to their short generation intervals, high adaptability and versatile feeding habits. the country has an estimated 1 3 million goats and 1 0 million sheep. annual meat production is estimated at 8 4,00 0 tonnes of mutton and chevron worth kes 1 4 billion.	n
235	feed production is negatively affected by both good harvests and famine situations. during good harvests, excess maize is exported unprocessed denying the industry the by products that are used for producing animal feeds. when there is a shortage in maize supply, famine relief is distributed directly to consumers denying the animal feeds industry the by products that would have been supplied by millers. like other inputs, availability of animal feeds is constrained by the cost and density of stockists.	n
236	have resulted in up to 4 0 per cent of post harvest losses. post harvest disease pathogens like aflatoxins have been reported with catastrophic effect sin some cases deaths among consumers in parts of the country.	n
237	diseases that threaten the health of fish include fungal and bacterial infections. symptoms of fungal diseases include cotton like growths on skin, mouth, eggs and barbels, which result in heavy loss of eggs and fry caused by poor handling. control may include adding a few milligrams of malachite green to the pond or enclosed water.	n
238	bacterial diseases result from parasitism, poor water quality and poor nutrition. they lead to loss of appetite and white spots around the mouths and fins, and fish exhibit a waddled or nervous swim pattern at or near the surface.	n
239	other health threats to fish are ectoparasites such as leeches, and endoparasites. while small numbers of parasites do little harm in most cases, in large numbers they can seriously compromise the health of fish. control and prevention of these pests and diseases are also the concern of the government.	n
240	heavy livestock losses to diseases and pests. livestock diseases and pests affect animal production and marketing and pose a threat to human health. specifically, they cause heavy losses through deaths, reduced productivity and loss of markets for products. the prevalence of transboundary diseases such as foot and mouth, chronic bovine pleuropneumonia, lumpy skin disease, trypanosomiasis, east coast fever, brucellosis, petites eds pests ruminants ppr, contagious caprice pleuropneumonia, rabies, newcastle disease, and gumbo disease continue to be a challenge. emerging and reemerging diseases that are also zoonotic like rift valley fever, avian flu and bovine tb need sustained surveillance.	n
241	low and declining soil fertility. the rising population density has contributed to the subdivision of land to uneconomically small units. in addition, the reduction of fallow periods and continuous cultivation have led to rapid depletion of soil nutrients, declining yields and environmental degradation.	n
242	expanding markets for traditional products like maize and other cereals, beef and dairy products, tea, coffee and pyre thrum exist. global demand for horticultural products, and emerging livestock such as ostrich, guinea fowl, crocodile, frogs and butterflies, gum arabic, and emerging crops such as assorted resins and essential oils, and aloe remain underexploited. vast opportunities are opening up in the production of biofuels from sugar cane, maize, millet, sorghum, atrophy and other oil bearing seeds.	n
243	potential for increasing yields. yields of crops and livestock are far below their optimum. yields of maize, sugar and dairy are one tenth of global potential. tripling national average yields of major crop and livestock production systems in the country is easily achievable.	n
244	large scale farming is practised on farms averaging 5 0 ha. it accounts for 3 0 per cent of marketed agricultural produce. large scale farmers mainly grow tea, coffee, horticultural crops, maize and wheat. sustained high use of inputs and better management have ensured that these farmers have higher yields than their small scale counterparts.	n
245	animal breeding. animal breeding is one of the key intervention areas for increased livestock productivity. currently, livestock productivity is negatively affected by poor genetic make up. the average milk yield is 5 litres per dairy cow per day; the carcass weight for beef animals is 12 0 kg. to increase overall productivity, these two parameters need to be improved through breeding using superior genetics. the country has a large and diverse reservoir of animal genetic resources. however, the database on species and breed diversity, population size, trends and distribution is inadequate and only available for a few species as no inventory or characterization has been undertaken. a complete inventory, characterization and documentation of animal genetic resources for conservation is needed.	n
246	feed and nutrition. livestock feeding and nutrition determines the productivity of the various livestock breeds. the main livestock feeds consist of roughage, concentrates, minerals and vitamins. concentrate feeds consisting of protein, energy, minerals and vitamins are important especially for poultry, dairy and pig production. these feeds account for up to 8 0 per cent of production costs of farm animals.	n
247	roughage sources is higher in these areas compared with the low rainfall areas where no inputs are used. grazing animals cattle, sheep, goats, camels, donkeys, etc. are fed on natural pastures or fodder with supplemental concentrates for high yielding animals.	n
248	some of the challenges in these regions include inadequate research on suitable forages, forage crop diseases, unavailability of planting material and lack of skills in forage management. use of rangelands for sustainable livestock production is hampered by seasonal variations of quality and quantity of forage; overstocking and overgrazing; tsetse infestation and communal conflicts; inadequate livestock support services, credit facilities and socio economic services; and weak infrastructure. non grazing animals such as pigs and poultry are fed mixed concentrates to meet their nutrient requirements. the concentrates are made from cereals such as maize, wheat, barley, oats, millet and sorghum, legumes and oilseed cakesoybean, cotton seed cake and sunflower and animal by products such as fishmeal, bloodmeal, meat and bonemeal. inconsistent supply of some of the ingredients especially the imported onesoil seed cake and meal, finer mineral elements, fishmeal, vitamins and amino acidshas a major effect on feed quality.	n
249	forage conservation is done as standing hay particularly in the asals, baled hay or silage. forage conservation is not widely practised. there is need to promote forage conservation in these areas to ensure feed availability during unfavourable conditions and feed scarcity for increased livestock productivity. this will include using various conservation technologies and establishing strategic feed reserves.	n
250	kenyas agro ecological zones are suitable for producing cereals and leguminous crops. crop residues could be mixed with other fodders or processed for feeding animals, especially during the dry season. use of crop residues is constrained by inadequate knowledge on how to use them, limited conservation technologies, low nutritive value, post harvest loss and their bulkiness.	n
251	has only 2 0 per cent of its required extension staff quota, a situation that is likely to deteriorate due to natural attrition and staff retirement.	n
252	notifiable diseases that had hitherto been brought under control, such as the contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, contagious caprice pneumococcal and foot and mouth, are now being widely reported. zoonotic diseases particularly those transmitted through milk, such as tuberculosis and brucellosis, are also becoming important. kenya faces new challenges from emerging and re emerging diseases such as the avian influenza, the rift valley fever and ppr, which require rapid and expensive response to contain.	n
253	the asals constitute 8 0 per cent of kenyas total land surface. these areas support over 2 5 per cent of the human population and have over half of the countrys livestock population. asals are fragile ecosystems with scarce and erratic rainfall patterns. despite the enormous livestock potential, development in these areas has been low compared with the rest of the country.	n
254	during periods of extreme drought, there is widespread migration of livestock to areas with better pastures, invariably leading to the spread of diseases and economic losses where disease control measures have not been put in place.	n
255	animal health and quality assurance services are important in efforts to increase productivity, reduce losses along the production to marketing chain, and to promote local and export trade. the services also protect humans from zoonoses and diseases transmitted through consuming animal products like meat, milk and eggs. the prevalence of diseases and pests has had negative economic impact such as loss of livelihood, humans and animals, and has curtailed access to markets for animals and animal products. further, misuse and abuse of pesticides, veterinary drugs and vaccines have introduced residues to the food chain predisposing humans, animals and the environment to toxicity and making them less resistant to microbial activity.	n
256	improving animal productivity. through this component, _ livestock breeding programmes will be enhanced to improve local breeds and achieve faster growth rate and higher slaughter weights.	n
257	the marine fishing industry in kenya is characterized by under exploited resources, overfishing and artisan fishery. the current inshore fish production is slightly over 750 0 tonnes valued at kes 63 5 million, which is approximately 5 per cent of the total annual landings. though the countrys coast is located within the rich tuna belt in the south west indian ocean, production from off shore waters is not yet established because fleets of the distant waters fishing nations do not land, trans ship or declare catches on kenyan waters.	n
258	for the riverine systems, restocking programmes and demarcation of fish sanctuaries and refugee sites shall be supported and protected.	n
259	catchment degradation is causing increased run off, flash flooding, reduced infiltration, erosion and siltation, and is undermining the limited sustainable water resource base in the country. it has invariably affected surface water availability as rivers and reservoirs dry up. the main causes of degradation are poor farming methods, population pressure and cutting down forests for agricultural land and fuelwood. for example, sediment yields from the eyewash giro and tana rivers have increased 11 5 times since 197 0.	n
260	over abstraction of surface water in some parts of the country, inappropriate land use practices, soil erosion in catchments and deterioration of riparian lands are causing flash floods and turbidity. siltation of water courses and storage facilities has led to serious degradation of the quantity and quality of water resources. poorly controlled discharge of effluent from industry and sewage outflows has also negatively affected the quality of water. the dramatic reduction in the depth of lake baring from over 1 5in 192 1 to an average of 1.8today, is due not only to reduced inflows but also to the increased sediment load from surrounding unprotected and degraded catchments.	n
261	several factors affect the way land is used. in some parts of the country, high population densities and cultural practices of dividing land for inheritance have resulted in highly fragmented and uneconomical plots. in some of these areas, land scarcity and population pressure have led the poor to convert marginal lands such as floodplains and slopes into farmland. this has led to increased vulnerability and has aggravated environmental damage. consequently, the affected agrarian groups are barely able to meet their subsistence needs. in some parts of the country with low population density, certain cultural practices and other factors lead to idle or under utilized land. in addition, glaring disparities exist with regard to gender, with few women owning land.	n
262	accelerated land degradation and declining land productivity. in urban areas, proliferation of informal settlements, urban sprawl and encroachment into protected land remain key challenges. the escalation of desertification as a result of land degradation and climate change poses risks to the lives of people living in asals.	n

335	from the early 1960 s, kenya has experienced generally increasing temperature trends over vast areas. over the inland areas, the trends in both minimum night early morning and maximum daytime temperatures depict a general warming increasing trend with time. however, the increase in the minimum temperatures is steeper than in maximum temperatures. the result of the steeper increase in t,,, and a less steep increase t,,,. is a reduction in the diurnal temperature range difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures   figure 1 on the next  depicts these trends.	n

338	 there is a general positive trend increase in rainfall events of september to february period suggesting a tendency for the short rains october december season to be extending into what is normally hot and dry period of january and february over most areas. this may be attributed to possibly more frequent occurrences of el nifio events occasionally coupled with relatively warmer sea surface temperatures over the western indian ocean along the coast of east africa and relatively cooler than average sea surface temperatures sets to the east of the indian ocean. this sea surface temperature pattern is conducive for enhancing rainfall over the country. even in the absence of el nifio conditions, this pattern over the indian ocean results into heavy rainfall during the short rains season as was the case in 196 1 6 2 and the recent 200 6 0 7 rainfall events.	n

341	lamu and carissa over the past half century data and figure from the kmd	n
342	what do these changing rainfall patterns and temperature increases locally, regionally and globally portend for kenya?	n
343	existing forested areas will undergo changes in vegetation types and species composition. new assemblages may be established, and more invasive species are projected to emerge. invasions are already evident as shown by the spread of provisos cauliflower mathenge. this species has colonised important ecosystems in baringo, tana river, carissa and other semi arid areas of the country. in addition, excessive growth of some tree species has been observed, e.g., the excessive growth of acacia firescreens after the 199 7 el nifio in the north eastern province and the consequent suppressed growth of various the projected rise in temperatures and long periods of drought will lead to more frequent and intense forest fires. these have in the recent past affected kenyas major forests including the may and mt. kenya forests. kenya has over the past 2 0 years lost more than 5,70 0 ha of forests per year to forest fires wreaking phenomenal economic damage that is yet to be quantified.	n
344	the rise in temperature could extend the ecosystems range of pests and pathogens. this is likely to affect many aspects of forests such as tree growth, survival, yield and quality of wood and non wood products. the impact of pests may result in the curtailment of plantation programmes, abandonment of a given tree species, or the necessity to harvest large areas dominated by infested trees as witnessed in the late 1990when the country had to clear huge tracts of cypress plantations because of cypress aphid attack. there are already fears of a widespread attack on pins spatula mexican weeping pine plantations in south africa and these could easily spread northwards to kenya.	n
345	changes in temperature will lead to a shift of vegetation to higher elevations while some species could become extinct. indeed, across the country, some tree species including amelia volkensii, terminal spinosa, decolonize elata, and hyphened covariance in the north eastern province, and psychotropic species in the taiga hills, coast province, are either tremendously dwindling in or extinct.	n
346	it is undeniable that climate change is currently affecting kenya. droughts and floods have become frequent and intense and the country has also seen an increase in average temperatures, hotter days, colder nights, successive crop failures and the spread of vector borne diseases such as malaria to places where the disease is not known to be endemic. these climatic changes affect resources critical to the health and prosperity of kenya. for example, the 199 9200 0 la finial droughts resulted in 4.7 million kenyans facing starvation, while according to unofficial reports, the effects of the 200 6 200 9 successive drought episodes caused 1 0 million people   over a fourth of the country's population   to starve.	n
347	small increase in sea level will leave mangroves submerged unless they can retreat further inland, which is improbable due to human settlements. research undertaken by the kenya marine and fisheries research institute frisk as well as other organizations and individuals indicates evidence of mangrove loss due to climate change and other factors in several areas along the kenyan coast such as gaze bay, machete creek, ngomeni, tana river delta and corridor creek.	n
348	2.2.1.2 rangelands and wildlife resources kenya's rangelands, which support millions of pastoralists and small scale agro pastoralists, mainly occur in areas where rainfall is low and erratic and soils are highly variable and infertile. therefore the rangelands are unsuitable for production of crops that are not drought tolerant. the rangelands are characterised by a number of habitat structures ranging from open grasslands to closed woody candor bushy vegetation with varying amounts and composition of grass cover and species.	n
349	the impacts of climate change on kenya's rangelands includechange in pasture productivity as has been observed in the north eastern province pen where extremely strong winds and flash floods erode and wash away grass seeds. consequently, the growth of grass is inhibited even during good rainfalls. loss of wildlife habitats emerge as a secondary impact of these factors,carbon dioxide fertilization, which leads to higher plant productivity, particularly the proliferation of invasive species,disruption of natural ecosystems and subsequent change in species ecological range, altering predator prey interactions, decoupling animals from food sources candor reducing habitat span, anddroughts that affect grasslands causing massive livestock and wildlife deaths and an increase in human human and wildlife human conflicts. cases of conflict have been reported in areas around the lower tana delta, laikipia, and lagdera. as an example, in the gladder case 200 5 warthogs attacked and killed goats and sheep to drink their intestinal fluids after the warthogs natural watering points dried up.	n
350	the kenyan coastline is characterised by a rich diversity of flora and fauna including fish, coral reefs and mangrove forests. kenyan coral reefs are well distributed around most of the oceanic islands. they buffer the coastline against the impacts of waves and the full force of storms and cyclones. with all its benefits, the kenyan coastline is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. the most vulnerable aspects of the coastline are developments in low lying areas which consist of agriculture, infrastructure and both tourist facilities and hotspots.	n
351	rising sea levels will lead to the inundation and displacement of coastal wetlands, the erosion of shorelines, increased salinity and the intrusion of saline water into coastal aquifers. saltwater intrusion into ground water resources and salt wedge estuaries are phenomena that have been observed already in some places such as lamu.	n
352	8  from the proceedings of the nccrs north eastern province regional workshop in carissa together we can tackle climate change	n
353	rising sea levels associated with melting glaciers and polar ice, plus sea temperature increase i.e. ocean waters absorbing the bulk of the heat from enhanced greenhouse effect also threaten to cause deadly floods and high tides in low lying coastal areas. increasing sea temperature in the indian ocean could affect the entire eastern african coast by increasing the frequency and intensity ofnifo  southern oscillation ens events klein et. al., 200 2.	n
354	further, predicted effects of climate change on mangroves include both more extreme droughts and flooding. in 199 7, 199 8 and 200 6, massive sedimentation due to erosion of terrigenous sediments following extremely heavy rainfall caused mangrove dieback in many areas along the kenyan coast. machete creek, a peri urban mangrove forest in mombasa was the most affected, losing close to 50 0 ha of mangrove forest kmfri, 200 8. this trend is likely to jeopardise the livelihoods of local people who depend on the mangroves particularly for fisheries, wood products and coastal protection. increase in atmospheric temperature and further sea level rise will only accelerate these trends.	n
355	according to the national environmental management authority's nema state of environment report of 200 6200 7, major floods periodically afflict lake victoria basin, the lower tana basin and the coastal region   occurring at least six times in the past 5 0 years. in these areas, higher turbidity, siltation, and sedimentation occur. floods carry fertiliser and pesticide residues into water bodies resulting in eutrophication, which has detrimental impacts on water quality and aquatic life. until recently, such episodes were assumed to represent natural climate variability but now scientific evidence points to climate change as the driving force behind the frequency and intensity of these events.	n
356	according to the same report, serious droughts have occurred at least 1 2 times in the past 5 0 years. major rivers including the tana, athi, sound miriu, eyewash giro and mara have experienced severe reduced volumes during droughts and many seasonal ones have completely dried up. the parts of the country most affected are the eastern, north eastern and parts of the rift valley provinces.	n
357	extreme climatic variations coupled with improper land use including deforestation have resulted into kenya reporting successive seasons of crop failure, increasing the countrys food insecurity. the 199 9200 0 la finial droughts resulted in 4.7 million kenyans facing starvation, while the effects of the 200 6 200 9 successive drought episodes were worse with unofficial reports indicating nearly 1 0 million kenyans faced starvation during the worst episode in 200 9. the decline in agricultural productivity may also be attributed to variation in the diurnal temperature range, which has profound effects on agricultural production systems because crops have specific range of temperatures within which they grow optimally.	n
358	drought leads to reduced forage availability, degradation of the environment and an increase in destitution. the 200 6 to 200 9 droughts are testament to the devastation that climate change could cause to the livestock sector.	n
359	the strong winds and dust storms prevailing in most parts of northern kenya have contributed to the reduction of forage availability as they sweep away top soil together with grass seeds, thus making grass regeneration impossible even when it rains.	n
360	in addition, climate has profound effects on populations of crop pests e.g. insects, mites, slugs, affecting their development, reproduction and dispersal. the rate at which most pests develop depends on temperature and every species has a particular threshold temperature above which development can occur, and below which development ceases. as is projected, temperatures will rise in the tropics enabling some pest species, particularly those with short life cycles such as aphids and the diamond back moths to complete more generations within a given year. these changes will potentially disrupt natural pest control and consequently increase the costs of doing so.	n
361	moreover, income losses from three horticultural crops grown along the kenyan coast   mangoes, cashew nuts and coconuts   are projected to reach us$ 47 2.8 million for one metre of sea level rise gok, 200 2.	n
362	1 4 elephants in 200 7, 2 8 in 200 8 and 3 7 in 200 9 due to extraordinary and prolonged dry seasons lately, the reduction in the volume of the mara river due to climatic variations and the destruction of the may catchment has had a toll on one of the wonders of the natural world   the spectacular migration of hundreds of wildebeests across the mara river as they migrate between the serengeti national park in tanzania and the mainsail mara reserve in kenya.	n
363	global warming is likely to disrupt and even destroy some of the tourist sites such as the snow caps of mt. kenya, the coastal rainforests, fragile marine ecosystems and the marine parks. for instance coral bleaching of the kenyan coral reef has been observed. sea levels are rising with the implication that some of the popular beaches will eventually disappear. already, hotels along the kenyan coastline have been forced to construct sea walls to protect against increasingly strong sea tides e.g. in manga and south coast. rising temperatures are changing weather and vegetation patterns across the globe, which in turn are forcing animal species to migrate to new areas in order to survive.	n
364	experts predict that one fourth of the earths plant and animal species will be headed for extinction by 205 0 if the warming trend over the years, sand has been accumulating all along the long stretch of the beach here, deposited by an ever rising high tide mark. the high tide mark is now attacking my beach fence, whereas in 199 7 it never reached within 2of it. since my home is on a raised bit of ground some 3 0from the high tide markfigurehave about 1 0 years beforehave to move. there is not much elsecan do.have heard similar stories of rising high tide mark from zanzibar to malindi, with fishing villages having to move further inland as the high tide began to invade their courtyards and homes. here in east africa, global warming with its predicted sea rise is not a future threat   it is here now	n
365	there is strong evidence partly linking ens events with systematic changes in plankton abundance and aquatic marine plant as well as animal composition over recent decades in many regions worldwide. the ens events with phases of warm water reduce plankton production, and cause fish stocks to decline. in addition, changes in ocean circulation are predicted to lead to loss of certain fish populations or establishment of new ones. temperature changes will likely result in changes of up welling patterns, which might affect fish spawning period and success of larvae, thereby altering the entire life cycle and size of fish populations.	n
366	heavy tropical storms and sea level rise that are projected with the changing climate will make fishing a dangerous activity. according to the chippy estimates, the sea level will rise by between 1 7 cm and 5 9 cm by the end of this century, which is well below estimates by other scientists who predict a rise of up to 1even if ghg emissions were kept at a low level.	n
367	fluctuation of river volumes and to some extent lake levels, alters breeding ecology not only of permanent populations but also of anadromous fishes, e.g. the eel anguilla sensibleness labia ta peters, 185 2 in yoke d.0., 199 8. such fluctuations also have a deleterious consequence on the overall fish production in the country. climate change is predicted to alter hydrological regimes, which in turn will influence biological, biogeochemical and hydrological functions of wetlands. however, owing to the heterogeneity of the wetlands, such impacts might be sitespecific. where these wetlands form important nursery grounds for fishery resources, changes in their functions would affect fisheries.	n
368	hydroelectric power generation is also affected by soil erosion and the consequent siltation of dams. the decline in hep production in 200 2 for instance was caused by both the reduced river flow volume due to the 199 9 200 0 droughts and the siltation of dams by the 199 7 199 8 el nifio floods**. the gross storage capacity of the humankind dam has reduced from 1 6 million cubic metres to 1 1 million cubic metres due to siltation. siltation is usually caused by heavy floods. other causes include poor farming methods especially upstream and deforestation.	n
369	2.2.3.4 human settlements and land use there are many ways that climate change could affect human settlements directly or indirectly. extreme climate conditions such as high wind, heavy rainfall, heat and cold can result in a wide range of scenarios such as tropical storms, floods, landslides, droughts and sea level rise. climatic catastrophes displace populations and cause sudden deaths, which in turn can lead to conflicts and civil unrest. landslides and mudslides caused by heavy storms have in the past claimed many lives especially in the kenya highlands. marabou district in central province, for instance, is an area prone to landslides.	n
370	kenya's health sector is vulnerable to climate change in three waysthe increase in vector borne diseases such as malaria and rvf	n
371	during floods especially those related to el  niff events, environmental diseases such as typhoid, amoeba, cholera, and bilharzia, normally associated with contaminated water and poor sanitation, reach epidemic levels in areas where water and sanitation facilities are inadequate or are in poor state. this was the case for nyanza, western, coast, eastern and north eastern provinces which recorded several cases of cholera outbreaks during the 199 7199 8 el nifio rains. in addition, warmer waters provide conditions conducive for the survival of the amoeba protozoan. this probably explains why cases of the disease have risen steadily in areas that were predominantly cold but are now experiencing temperature rise like in lower eastern province.	n
372	submerged huts in western kenya. during floods especially those related to el nifio events, environmental diseases such as typhoid, amoeba, cholera and bilharzia normally associated with contaminated water and poor sanitation reach epidemic levels in such places.	n
373	climatic catastrophes like floods are also likely to cause populations to be displaced, or even lead to death, further burdening the health sector. our over stretched public health system for example, would be eroded further if 2 3 who 200 8 climate change and human health resources are diverted from its maintenance to disaster recovery.	n
374	last but not least, malnutrition as a result of droughts can have a tremendous impact on those dependent on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods. according to the world health organization who, malnutrition causes millions of deaths each year from both a lack of sufficient nutrients to sustain life and the resulting vulnerability to infectious diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea, and respiratory illnesses.2? such cases abound especially in asals during any episode of la  finial induced drought.	n
375	it is universally accepted that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity this century. in kenya, this phenomenon is already unmistakable and intensifying at an alarming rate as is evident from countrywide temperature increases and rainfall irregularity and intensification.	n
376	these climate driven changes affect resources critical for economic development of kenya. an example is the 199 9200 0 la finial droughts, which left approximately 4.7 million kenyans facing starvation. in addition, increased average temperatures have led to the spread of vector borne diseases like malaria to areas where the disease is not known to be endemic.	n

379	from the early 1960 s, kenya has generally experienced increasing temperatures over vast areas. over inland areas, the trends in both minimum night timeearly morning and maximum daytime temperatures depict a general warming through time. however, the increase in the minimum temperatures is steeper than in maximum temperatures. the combined effect of a steeper increase in minimum temperatures and a less steep increase in maximum temperatures is a lower daily diurnal temperature range.	n
380	the ipecac defines vulnerability as the extent to which climate change may damage or harm a system and adds that vulnerability depends not only on a systems sensitivity, but also on its ability to adapt to new climatic conditions.	n

426	malaria remains a health and socio economic burden and accounts for 3 0 per cent of outpatient consultations, 1 9 per cent of hospital admissions and 3 5 per cent of inpatient deaths. in order to reduce the upsurge of malaria, the government has been issuing insecticides treated nets tins to children and pregnant women and undertaking indoor residual spraying. this led to a significant reduction in infant mortality from 7 3.7 per cent in 200 0 to 5 2 per cent in 201 1, and under five mortality rate from 11 1.5 per cent to 7 4 within the same period.	n
